        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The presence of white blood cells (WBCs) in urine is called pyuria; the presence of WBCs and bacteria (bacteriuria) in conjunction with the patient’s clinical symptom suggests a UTI <ulink url="ch0004.xml#ch0004s0002bib01">(1)</ulink>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The pretest probability of a positive urine culture is high when both WBCs and bacteria are found in urine. One caution, though: STIs can cause pyuria in both men and women. If the urine is not transported properly and is allowed to stay at room temperature for several hours, bacteria that are part of the urethral microflora could grow, causing a false-positive microscopic exam for bacteria and a culture only growing mixed urogenital microbiota. Urine cultures growing mixed normal microbiota can be found in up to 20% of females, so this is not an infrequent occurrence. The visualization of bacteria on microscopic examination in urine has high sensitivity but modest specificity. The important finding in detecting infection is the presence of WBCs.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  If this was the patient’s initial UTI, the physician might choose to treat empirically without even doing a culture, thinking it was unlikely that the patient had an organism with antimicrobial resistance. Other physicians might be more cautious and do a urine culture so they can determine the etiology and receive the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The signs and symptoms of both <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>—frequency, dysuria, pyuria, and lower abdominal pain—are similar to those of a UTI. Since she is younger than 25 years old, sexually active, and does not use condoms, the CDC recommends that she be screened for these two STIs <ulink url="ch0004.xml#ch0004s0002bib02">(2)</ulink>. Both can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can jeopardize her reproductive health due to fallopian tube scarring, resulting in ectopic pregnancy or sterility. In addition, the CDC recommends that all individuals between 16 and 64 know their human immunodeficiency virus status. There is no evidence that this testing was done.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Precise quantification of bacteria by culture is used most frequently when culturing urine. Urine is not sterile, so the presence of low numbers of bacteria would have a low positive predictive value for infection. A count of a single type of bacteria of &gt;100,000 CFU/ml has a high positive predictive value for UTIs. Accurate colony counts are dependent upon two important preanalytical steps prior to culture. One is the collection of a midstream culture, such that resident urethral microbiota are “washed out” before collection of urine into the specimen transport device, and the other is appropriate transport and handling of the urine specimen after collection. Because bacteria can reproduce in urine at room temperature, two approaches can be used to ensure proper transport/handling.</para>

Simply put, organism numbers remain essentially the same when stored in the tube containing preservatives. Mac Conkey agar is a selective (grows only Gram-negative organisms) and differential medium. A differential medium can separate organisms into different groups based on some phenotypic characteristic. Mac Conkey agar differentiates organisms that ferment lactose (pink colonies) and those that do not (clear colonies).</para>
        <para>The pink colonies seen on the Mac Conkey plate (<ulink url="ch0004.xml#ch0004s0004fg02">Fig. 1.2</ulink>) indicate that the patient is infected with a lactose-fermenting organism. Three genera that are lactose fermenters are commonly recovered from the urine of patients with UTIs: <emphasis>Klebsiella</emphasis>, <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Enterobacter</emphasis>. They are often referred to as “KEE” organisms. The one most frequently associated with UTIs is <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>. In young, sexually active women, such as this patient, it may be responsible for as many as 80% of community-acquired UTIs.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Antimicrobial resistance is uncommon in an individual who does not have a history of a UTI. Since the patient is uncomfortable but not seriously ill, she should be treated on an outpatient basis. Specifically, she should be treated with an antimicrobial agent that can be given orally. There are four antimicrobials—cefazolin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin—to which the organism is reported to be susceptible and have an oral option. These antimicrobials will reach high concentrations in the bladder. Which agent the clinician chooses should be based on several factors <ulink url="ch0004.xml#ch0004s0002bib05">(5)</ulink>. First, will the patient tolerate the antimicrobial chosen? For example, patients are more likely to have allergies to β-lactams (e. g., cephalexin) and sulfa-containing drugs (e. g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Second, how likely will the patient be compliant with the recommended antimicrobial course? The shorter the antimicrobial course and the less complicated the dosing regimen, the greater the compliance. In an uncomplicated UTI as seen in this case, the simplest course and dosing regimen is a single oral dose of fosfomycin. A 3-day course of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or ciprofloxacin is recommended while a 5-day course is recommended for an oral cephalosporin. The third factor to consider is the impact of the agents on antimicrobial resistance. Resistance to common urinary pathogens is unusual with both fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin but can be problematic with both trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. However, efficacy may be greater with a short course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole compared to nitrofurantoin. Fosfomycin may not be active against some common UTI pathogens. Fourth, ciprofloxacin disrupts the gut microbiome more than nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or fosfomycin, placing the patient at risk for <emphasis>Clostridiodes difficile</emphasis> infection. Fifth, both ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are broader spectrum than the other two agents. There is concern that the widespread use of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat UTIs, which are among the most frequently treated infections, contributes to an increased “resistome,” a term used to describe all antimicrobial resistance genes among both pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms <ulink url="ch0004.xml#ch0004s0002bib06">(6)</ulink>. In addition, care providers may choose drugs based on their experience in treating specific patient populations in specific clinical scenarios.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  The lack of fever and flank pain or tenderness is strong evidence that this patient had a lower UTI or cystitis. Cystitis is generally treated with a short course of oral antimicrobial (see <phrase>answer to question 7</phrase>) on an outpatient basis <ulink url="ch0004.xml#ch0004s0002bib05">(5)</ulink>. Patients with pyelonephritis require more-prolonged antimicrobial therapy <ulink url="ch0004.xml#ch0004s0002bib07">(7)</ulink>. Oral ciprofloxacin (7 days) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (14 days) is commonly used. In more severe cases of pyelonephritis, intravenous antimicrobials may be used. The choice of antimicrobial should be based on the causative organism’s antimicrobial susceptibility and the pharmacokinetics of the active antimicrobials. Once the patient has improved clinically and if the organism is susceptible to an oral cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the patient can complete therapy using oral agents. Patients with pyelonephritis should not be treated with nitrofurantoin, because the drug penetrates poorly into the kidney, the site of infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  Approximately 85% of UTIs occur in women, with young, sexually active women having the highest rate of UTIs. The proximity of the female urethra to the anus allows particular strains of uropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> found in the gut microbiota to colonize the periurethral epithelium <ulink url="ch0004.xml#ch0004s0002bib08">(8)</ulink>.</para>
        <para>Uropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> are highly adapted for causing UTIs and produce specific adhesins called type 1 pili that mediate binding to the periurethral epithelium. Sexual activity is thought to enhance, although is not required for, binding to the urethra. Once bound to the urethra, the organism can ascend to the bladder, where it can bind to the umbrella cells, epithelial cells on the bladder lumen. Uropathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> strains also produce two other important virulence factors, α-hemolysin, a cytotoxin that lyses epithelial cells, releasing nutrients to support the growth of the bacteria; and siderophores, molecules that scavenge iron, a key nutrient required for bacterial enzyme systems.</para>
