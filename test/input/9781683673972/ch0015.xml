A week prior to presentation he had a sudden onset of weakness, myalgia, fever, and cough. At presentation, only the weakness and cough remained. He also endorsed dizziness and light-headedness, but no headache, visual disturbances, chest pain, shortness of breath, or gastrointestinal symptoms. In the ED, his temperature was 99.8°F, heart rate 94 beats/minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute, blood pressure 99/76 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Most at-home tests for COVID-19 are rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib01">(1)</link>. These tests detect virus-specific protein from a self-collected nasal swab. Historically, RADTs have been used for other respiratory viruses, like influenza and RSV, with varying performance characteristics. Analytical sensitivity is a concern for RADTs <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib02">(2)</link>. False negatives may occur, particularly early in the disease course. Specificity is generally high, though false positives may occur and are more likely in times of low disease prevalence <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib03">(3)</link>. A test should be performed as soon as symptoms occur. If the RADT is negative, a rapid test should be repeated in 48 hours or a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) should be sought before COVID-19 is ruled out.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Early in the pandemic, it was recognized that asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals could be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and transmit it to others <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib04">(4)</link>. To interrupt the transmission cycle, some health care facilities and workplaces instituted routine asymptomatic screening once test availability was stable <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Asymptomatic testing was used as a component of contact tracing (i. e., when a person is exposed to COVID-19), hospital admission testing, and presurgical screening, particularly when prevalence was high. Some advocated for asymptomatic testing for routine surveillance; many college campuses employed this approach to minimize on-campus spread<link linkend="ch0015s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Now several years into the pandemic, routine asymptomatic screening is no longer recommended in the hospital setting <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib07">(7)</link>. To avoid false-negative results, it is recommended that an asymptomatic person who has been exposed to COVID-19 test every 48 hours up to 5 days postexposure or when they develop symptoms <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib08">(8)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Since the patient’s positive test was 7 days prior and other respiratory viruses were circulating, the clinical team wanted to confirm his SARS-CoV-2 infection and rule out coinfection with other common respiratory viruses. Even though his symptoms began a week prior, the likelihood that a NAAT would still be positive for SARS-CoV-2 was high. This is due to the greater sensitivity of molecular tests compared to RADTs and the fact that a more invasive nasopharyngeal swab (as opposed to self-collected nasal swab) is collected for the NAAT.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  COVID-19 may cause a myriad of symptoms in the outpatient setting, though the most common are respiratory symptoms that range from mild cold-like symptoms to an influenza-like illness with fever, fatigue, cough, and headache <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 may also cause loss of taste or smell and gastrointestinal symptoms. Most patients recover in 4 to 8 days, though resolution of cough and fatigue may take longer <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib10">(10)</link>. People who are ≥65 years old, immunocompromised, or have underlying health conditions such as obesity; chronic kidney, liver, heart, or lung disease; diabetes; pregnancy; or cancer are at greater risk for severe COVID-19 and hospitalization <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib11">(11)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Monoclonal antibodies that target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were developed during the pandemic and were shown to reduce morbidity and mortality <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib12">(12)</link>. At the time of this patient’s infection, the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was predominant (<link linkend="ch0015s0001fg01">Fig. 12.1</link>), and there were still monoclonal antibodies with activity <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Unfortunately, throughout the pandemic variants emerged with mutations that rendered various monoclonal antibodies ineffective <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Monoclonal antibodies are no longer recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 given the resistance observed with the circulating Omicron subvariants <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib15">(15)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid with general anti-inflammatory properties. In patients with severe COVID-19, corticosteroid use was associated with a 20% reduction in mortality <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Toculizumab is a monoclonal antibody originally approved for use in patients with autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It acts by inhibiting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor; IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine shown to be elevated in severe COVID-19 <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib17">(17)</link>. In 2021, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the use of toculizumab in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are also receiving corticosteroids and have an oxygen requirement <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Toculizumab was shown to improve 28-day survival <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that inhibits RNA polymerase and, therefore, viral replication. It is approved and recommended for use in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib20">(20)</link>. Unlike remdesivir, which is administered intravenously, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) is administered orally. Nirmatrelvir is a protease inhibitor with antiviral activity against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Coadministration of ritonavir (in Paxlovid) is needed so that nirmatrelvir concentrations reach therapeutic levels. Ritonavir is a cytochrome P450-3A4 inhibitor that has been used with protease inhibitors in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It should be noted that there are numerous drug-drug interactions with Paxlovid that must be carefully managed <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib21">(21)</link>. The combination drug, Paxlovid, is recommended for use in nonhospitalized persons ≥12 years old at risk for severe COVID-19; it should be taken within 5 days of symptom onset <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib22">(22)</link>. CDC recommends Paxlovid for adults ≥50 years old, unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals, and people with underlying medical conditions (as discussed previously) <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib23">(23)</link>.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  ECMO, which uses a bypass heart-lung machine to oxygenate blood, may be used in the clinical setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after failure of ventilation therapy <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib24">(24)</link>. It is generally considered “rescue therapy” due to the high mortality rate of patients receiving ECMO (60 to 77%), even before COVID-19 <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib25">(25)</link>. At our hospital, the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO was 61%, with age ≥50 years old, ≥7 days of pre-ECMO respiratory support, and pre-ECMO renal failure being the greatest risk factors for mortality <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib26">(26)</link>. A meta-analysis reported overall mortality of 39% <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib27">(27)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Patients are often initially hospitalized due to hypoxia caused by primary viral pneumonia. Unlike with influenza, SARS-CoV-2 coinfection and superinfection with bacteria are less common <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib28">(28)</link>. About half of hospitalized patients have at least one additional complication <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib29">(29)</link>. These include acute kidney injury; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; acute liver injury; cardiac complications (myocardial injury, arrhythmia, heart failure); pulmonary complications (ARDS, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax); neurological complications (stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, delirium); psychiatric manifestations (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder); and systemic complications (sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolism). Interestingly, fungal pneumonia due to <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis> has been observed and is associated with poor outcomes in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (<link linkend="ch0015s0002bib30">30</link>, <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib31">31</link>). For mucormycosis, risk factors include uncontrolled diabetes and overuse of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib32">(32)</link>. Another unique complication is multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS), which has been observed in both adults (MIS-A) and children (MIS-C) but is more prevalent in pediatric patients <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib33">(33)</link>. MIS-C is a rare but serious postinfection complication of COVID-19 where patients develop fever, multisystem organ dysfunction, and significant inflammation requiring hospitalization <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib34">(34)</link>. Fortunately, the incidence of MIS has been decreasing with time, likely due to the emergence of new viral variants and the availability of vaccines. Lastly, long COVID (or post-COVID conditions) has been observed even in people who had subclinical or mild SARS-CoV-2 infections (incidence estimate, 7.5 to 41%) (<link linkend="ch0015s0002bib35">35</link>, <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib36">36</link>). However, it is more common in people who have had severe COVID-19, those who have not been vaccinated, and those with multiple COVID-19 infections. Many wide-ranging symptoms have been associated with long COVID; these may include long-lasting fatigue, fever, respiratory and heart symptoms, and neurologic symptoms including “brain fog” and headaches. Long COVID may last from weeks to years and has been recognized as a potential disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Fortunately, long COVID incidence appears to be decreasing since Omicron became the dominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib37">(37)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  The rapid development of vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 is the result of decades of research committed to mRNA vaccine development <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib38">(38)</link>. The use of this technology in COVID-19 vaccines prevented millions of deaths due to COVID-19 and led to Drs. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2023. Vaccines based on mRNA technology rely on the host’s cellular machinery to convert the mRNA into the S (spike) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is a surface glycoprotein. When host cells translate the mRNA to produce spike protein, the immune system produces anti-spike antibodies. In addition, an adenovirus-vector vaccine that delivers viral DNA and a protein-based vaccine, both still based on the S protein, were developed and authorized by the FDA. Early studies on vaccine effectiveness reported ~90% efficacy for symptomatic and asymptomatic infections <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib39">(39)</link>. However, with the continued evolution of the virus, which resulted in significant mutations in the S gene, it quickly became apparent that while the vaccines conferred some cross-protection to new variants, they were less effective at preventing symptoms. More importantly, the vaccines remain highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19 and reducing hospitalizations and deaths <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib40">(40)</link>. It is likely that CDC will recommend annual vaccination with an updated COVID-19 vaccine, much like is done for influenza <link linkend="ch0015s0002bib41">(41)</link>.</para>
