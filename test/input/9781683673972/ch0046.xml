      <sect1 id="ch0046s0004"><title>CASE 43</title><para>A 32-year-old woman with a 6-week history of diarrhea secondary to ulcerative colitis on infliximab presented to the emergency department (ED). She had returned from a trip to Provence in France 4 days previously, and over the 3 days following her return her diarrhea had worsened. She presented to the ED with a temperature of 38.5°C, blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, and white blood cell count of 14,500/μl with 90% neutrophils. Two sets of blood cultures were obtained. She was admitted to the infectious disease service, where she was begun on 2 g of ceftriaxone intravenously every 12 hours.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum that is frequently associated with periods of chronic diarrhea followed by periods of remission. Diarrhea in individuals with ulcerative colitis will often be bloody <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Infliximab belongs to a class of therapeutic agents called immunomodulators (<link linkend="ch0046s0002bib02">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib03">3</link>). Immunomodulators are used to treat a variety of chronic conditions associated with immune system disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunomodulators fit into two broad categories: biologics, which are primarily monoclonal antibodies, which act against specific targets in the immune system, neutralizing their activity; or small molecules, which also inhibit the activity of specific immune system targets. Infliximab is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine that impacts a variety of inflammatory pathways. Inhibition of TNF-α by infliximab was shown in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials to produce a dose-dependent, statistically significant clinical response (<link linkend="ch0046s0002bib02">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib04">4</link>). As a result, infliximab has become a standard therapy for treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib01">(1)</link>. All immunomodulators carry a “box warning.” FDA mandates these warnings be present in a box in the drug package insert. They describe severe adverse events observed in individuals taking these agents. Television commercials for different drugs carry these warnings at the end, often in rushed language.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The organism is a Gram-positive bacillus. The morphology of the Gram-positive bacillus is important, as we will learn as we work through this case. Multiple morphotypes of Gram-positive bacilli are encountered in patients with bacteremia as well as other types of infections. Empiric therapy for the organisms discussed here may differ, so understanding the different Gram-positive bacilli morphotypes has clinical significance. The morphotype here is consistent with the organism causing this patient’s infection.</para>
        <para>When seen in blood cultures, the genera with the Gram stain morphology shown in <link linkend="ch0046s0004fg01">Fig. 43.1</link> are most likely <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cutibacterium</emphasis>. Both have similar morphologies to the patient’s organism seen in <link linkend="ch0046s0004fg01">Fig 43.1</link>, but <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> spp. tend to be more club-shaped and clustered, while <emphasis>Cutibacterium</emphasis> spp. are more curved and often in a spider-like arrangement.</para>
        <para><link linkend="ch0046s0001fg02">Figure 43.2</link> shows large Gram-variable (left panel) and -positive (right panel) bacilli. Gram-variable bacilli (left panel) are exactly that; some are Gram positive (purple) and some are Gram negative (pink). Three genera of bacteria with this Gram stain morphology encountered clinically are <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp., and <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. The boxy, Gram-positive morphology in the right panel is more consistent with <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp.; however, certain <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> species may share a similar morphology.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> spp. can cause serious infections such as anthrax (<emphasis>Bacillus anthracis</emphasis>) and <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. cause gas gangrene (<emphasis>Clostridium septicum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Clostridium perfringens</emphasis>). They can also be contaminants in blood cultures. On the other hand, <emphasis>Lactobacillus</emphasis> spp. are almost always a contaminant in blood cultures. If found in multiple blood culture sets (an exceedingly rare occurrence), it may indicate that the patient has endocarditis.</para>
        <para>Another distinctive positive Gram stain is seen in <link linkend="ch0046s0001fg03">Fig. 43.3</link>. The organism is thin, pleiotropic (many forms), and may have pseudo-branching. This organism belongs to the genus <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis>, and this particular Gram stain is from an aspirate of a brain abscess. <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> species are anaerobic bacteria associated with brain, lung, and jaw abscesses.</para>
        <para>The final Gram stain (<link linkend="ch0046s0001fg03">Fig. 43.4</link>) shows a “beaded” Gram-positive organism due to the irregular, bead-like staining pattern. This staining appearance is found in what are called “higher-order” bacteria. The two most common genera with this appearance on Gram stain are <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis>. This particular organism is <emphasis>Mycobacterium abscessus</emphasis> complex recovered from a blood culture.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The Gram stain of the organism detected from blood culture shows relatively small, Gram-positive bacilli with straight, parallel walls characteristic of <emphasis>Listeria monocytogenes</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>It is almost always obtained by the consumption of contaminated food. Foods most frequently contaminated by <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> include soft cheeses, which may not be made with pasteurized milk; processed meats (cold cuts); and fresh fruits and vegetables that are contaminated with either animal or human feces <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> is a facultative intracellular pathogen. TNFα is a proinflammatory cytokine that recruits and activates neutrophils and macrophages, enhancing their ability to kill bacteria. Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit TNF-α activity place individuals at risk for infection with a wide variety of intracellular pathogens, including <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis>, <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis>, and the dimorphic fungus <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis> (see the infliximab box warning for other organisms for which she is at risk) <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  There is very limited information in the literature about bacteremia in individuals with ulcerative colitis. Ceftriaxone was likely chosen because of its ease of administration (once or twice daily) and broad spectrum of activity. <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> is clinically resistant to ceftriaxone and as such is not a good choice for treating this patient <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib07">(7)</link>. By knowing the patient’s history, especially her dietary one, coupled with the blood culture Gram stain result, the patient’s clinicians could switch her to an appropriate antimicrobial at least 18 to 24 hours earlier than if they had to wait for a subculture of the organism to grow so it could be identified. The patient was switched to ampicillin and made an uneventful recovery.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Vertical transmission of <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> carries a significant risk of fetal or neonatal mortality. In the largest outbreak of food-borne <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> on record, 50% of the &gt;900 cases occurred during pregnancy, with close to 43% occurring in neonates, with a 28% mortality <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Early-onset disease occurred in 95% of neonates. Fetal loss occurred in 27 of 59 infected pregnant woman (46%). These data support vertical transmission as the major mode of transmission. Letting the individual, if pregnant, know of the potential risks of eating soft cheeses, cold cuts, and undercooked meat to the fetus would seem prudent. In addition, clinicians should be aware that outbreaks may occur with other types of foods. Examples of <emphasis>Listeria</emphasis> outbreaks with other foods include stone fruits (peaches, plums, nectarines), ice cream, and leafy greens (<link linkend="ch0046s0002bib09">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0046s0002bib10">10</link>).</para>
