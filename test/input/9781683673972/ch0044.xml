He had no constitutional symptoms and no response to oral or topical antibacterials (agents not specified in the history). He had no lesions elsewhere, nor did he have trauma at the inoculation site. His prior travel history was significant for having returned from the Amazon rainforest region of Peru 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms. In Peru, he stayed in an open-sided hut that did not have screens or windows. He had countless insect bites and had no pretravel immunizations, nor did he take malaria prophylaxis. In the United States, he lived in a rural community with three cats and one dog.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Dermatologic manifestations of infectious diseases in a returning traveler vary and can include rashes of multiple types, lesions, ulcers, and nodules <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Where the patient traveled and what types of exposures (e. g., insect bites, water, animals) they had while traveling are important for determining the possible cause. Since the patient did not have systemic illness, it is unlikely that the patient has a disease like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, which can each have dermatologic manifestations. Bacterial infections with <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis>may cause ecthyma (ulcers), so could be a possibility in this case, although less likely since the ulcer had not improved with topical antibacterial therapy. Cutaneous anthrax should be considered when a patient has traveled, particularly in rural areas where they may have had contact with cattle, goats, sheep, or unprocessed products made from these animals (e. g., hides or wool)<link linkend="ch0044s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The ulcer associated with cutaneous anthrax begins shallow but develops into a black eschar. Infection with mycobacteria should be considered, particularly if a patient had water exposure or sustained an injury while in an aquatic environment. Finally, leishmaniasis should always be considered in travelers returning from areas of endemicity, including Africa’s northeastern quadrant, Latin America, South and Central Asia, Mediterranean coastal areas, and the Middle East <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Notably, cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions begin as typical insect bites, but progress into painless shallow ulcers with raised margins over time.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The lesion and travel history to Peru suggest infection due to <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> (<emphasis>Viannia</emphasis>) <emphasis>braziliensis</emphasis>. <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> (<emphasis>Viannia</emphasis>) is a subgroup of the genus <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis>, with <emphasis>L</emphasis>. (<emphasis>V</emphasis>.) <emphasis>braziliensis</emphasis> the most common cause of cutaneous disease in patients who have been in the Amazon basin, including the region of Peru where the patient traveled <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Leishmaniasis is one of the most common reasons why individuals who have traveled to South America and developed skin lesions consult a physician, especially if the lesion is slowly healing, as was the case here <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Leishmaniasis is endemic in 99 countries, primarily within the tropics and subtropics, and is considered one of the top 10 neglected tropical diseases, affecting over 12 million people globally <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib05">(5)</link>. The human stages of leishmaniasis start with the promastigote, which is the infectious stage of the parasite <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib06">(6)</link>. This flagellated protozoan stage develops in the gut of the sand fly. It migrates to the sand fly proboscis, where it is injected into the skin during the sand fly’s blood meal. The organism is taken up by macrophages, where it converts to the round, nonflagellated amastigote form. The sand fly takes the amastigote during a blood meal, converting it back to the promastigote in the sand fly gut and completing the life cycle.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>   The stage of the organism seen in <link linkend="ch0044s0004fg03">Fig. 41.3</link> is the amastigote form. The amastigote proliferates in the phagolysosome of the macrophage. This infection results in an ulcerative papulonodular lesion with raised edges. However, these edges are not readily apparent in <link linkend="ch0044s0004fg01">Fig. 41.1</link> and <link linkend="ch0044s0004fg02">41.2</link>. Typically, the lesion will have a central area of necrosis. In the early stages of infection, the raised edges of the lesion contain macrophages filled with amastigotes, surrounded by lymphocytes. For this reason, the appropriate diagnostic specimen is a biopsy of the edge of the lesion. If a biopsy is performed in the central area of the lesion, where crusting is apparent (as can be seen in <link linkend="ch0044s0004fg02">Fig. 41.2</link>), few organisms will be observed. This lesion will continue to expand outward until cell-mediated immunity eliminates the parasite. Over time, granulomatous inflammation with lymphocyte predominance occurs, and the macrophages filled with amastigotes are eliminated. Data suggest that the cytokines interleukin-2 and gamma interferon play a key role in eliminating this parasite through macrophage activation. As healing continues, granulation tissue forms that contains both giant and epithelioid cells. In most cases, the lesion slowly heals and leaves a scar. This disease process occurs over many months. Because the lesions frequently occur on the face, disfiguring scars are common in areas where <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> is endemic <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para>In this case, the amastigotes were observed in a Giemsa-stained biopsy of the lesion. It is important to note that the yeast phase of <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis> is similar in shape and size to the amastigotes of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis>. However, the internal structure of amastigotes is quite different from that of <emphasis>Histoplasma,</emphasis> with the presence of a kinetoplast (the distinctive, small, round organelle accompanying the nucleus that contains a large mass of DNA). A skilled pathologist should be able to differentiate the two organisms easily. It is important to note that the amastigotes of <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> are morphologically indistinguishable from <emphasis>Trypanosoma cruzi</emphasis> (Chagas disease) amastigotes.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Cutaneous leishmaniasis is often diagnosed clinically by physicians experienced with this infection. However, this disease is not endemic in the United States, Canada, and Northern Europe; thus, few physicians there will have seen an actual case. Since cutaneous leishmaniasis can be confused with other conditions, including leprosy, tertiary syphilis, dimorphic fungal infections, and noninfectious causes, laboratory support for this diagnosis helps determine appropriate management and therapy. Later in the disease course, the organism burden will likely be less, and microscopic examination will be insensitive. Culture is more sensitive than microscopic examination <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib08">(8)</link>. In this case, the organism was cultured using triple N medium, an enriched medium designed to recover <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis>. When grown on artificial medium, the promastigote form can be seen (<link linkend="ch0044s0004fg04">Fig. 41.4</link>). In patients with suspected <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> infection, this culture medium can be obtained in the United States from the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria at the CDC, and they will also perform the culture.</para>
        <para>In addition to improved sensitivity later in the disease course, culture offers the opportunity to improve parasite yield for strain typing, which may be used to inform treatment options<link linkend="ch0044s0002bib09">(9)</link>. This is especially true for <emphasis>Vianna</emphasis> strains, which nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based methods may struggle to differentiate. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene recommend multiple diagnostic testing approaches to diagnose leishmaniasis <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib10">(10)</link>. In the United States and Canada, the primary reference laboratories for leishmaniasis testing include Mc Gill University in Montreal, the CDC in Atlanta, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington, DC.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>Globally, various test methods are used for the detection of leishmaniasis, including parasitological examination (e. g., histopathology, microscopy, culture), serology, and molecular methods<link linkend="ch0044s0002bib08">(8)</link>. The test used will often depend on the type of leishmaniasis the patient has, diagnostic resources, and test availability. The most sensitive method for detecting <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> is NAAT <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib11">(11)</link>. NAAT is most useful in the late stages of cutaneous disease when culture and direct microscopic examination are less sensitive because of low organism burden. While NAAT is most commonly performed by the CDC, a real-time PCR has recently been cleared by the FDA for use in clinical laboratories <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib12">(12)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  The three forms of leishmaniasis are cutaneous (as seen in this patient), mucocutaneous, and visceral <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Cutaneous leishmaniasis can cause a localized, typically self-limited disease (as seen in this case) and a diffuse, chronic one. In Europe, Africa, and Asia, cutaneous leishmaniasis is usually caused by <emphasis>Leishmania tropica</emphasis> and <emphasis>Leishmania major </emphasis><link linkend="ch0044s0002bib13">(13)</link>. In South and Central America, <emphasis>L</emphasis>. (<emphasis>V</emphasis>.) <emphasis>braziliensis</emphasis> (Amazon basin) and <emphasis>Leishmania mexicana</emphasis> (Central America and Mexico) predominate. However, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis can result from infection with any <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib14">(14)</link>. The symptoms of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis can develop between 2 and 8 weeks after a person is bitten by a sand fly, and these include the formation of lesions, which may turn into ulcers. While in many cases the ulcers resolve on their own without treatment, this can take months to years and can result in considerable scarring <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>
        <para>The patient does not mount a cellular immune response to the parasite in the diffuse cutaneous form of leishmaniasis. Lesions characterized by the presence of amastigote-filled macrophages, as well as the presence of free parasites in tissue, are observed. Because of the immune response’s failure, no immune-mediated necrosis is seen. These lesions can disseminate throughout the skin and be found throughout the body surface. These infections do not respond well to antiparasitic treatment. A third variant of cutaneous leishmaniasis is leishmaniasis recidivans<link linkend="ch0044s0002bib14">(14)</link>. In this chronic disease, typically caused by <emphasis>L. tropica</emphasis>, there is recurrence at the site of the initial lesion after a period of dormancy as long as 15 years. Alternatively, some data suggest that the lesions represent reinfection rather than recurrence. This type of cutaneous leishmaniasis can also be caused by <emphasis>L. major</emphasis> or <emphasis>L. braziliensis</emphasis>, but the frequency of these cases is less than those caused by <emphasis>L. tropica</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is a rare manifestation seen primarily after cutaneous infections with <emphasis>L. (V.) braziliensis</emphasis>, South America’s most recognized <emphasis>Leishmania</emphasis> species <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib14">(14)</link>. As the name implies, this disease is found primarily in the nasal and oral mucous membranes. The organism spreads either hematogenously or from adjacent lesions. The lesions result from a severe inflammatory response to the parasite, even though few parasites can be seen in the mucocutaneous lesions. This hyperimmune response causes necrosis of soft tissues, including the nasal septum, soft palate, lips, and gums. Interestingly, it has been postulated that a double-stranded RNA virus found within <emphasis>L. (V.) braziliensis</emphasis> may stimulate host Toll-like receptor 3, inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines contributing to the disease’s severity <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Other species that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis are rarely associated with this form of this disease. Treatment for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis includes systemic and topical options. Systemic treatment with pentavalent antimonials is considered the gold standard treatment, but there can be significant side effects, including bone marrow suppression and hepatitis <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Topical treatment options include pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical options, including cryotherapy, application of heat, surgical excision, and cauterization.</para>
        <para>The third form of the disease is visceral leishmaniasis, also known as “kala-azar” and “black fever.” This disease is seen primarily in the South Asian subcontinent. Most cases globally are due to <emphasis>Leishmania donovani</emphasis>. Other species associated with visceral disease are <emphasis>Leishmania infantum</emphasis> (in infants, as the name implies) and <emphasis>Leishmania chagasi</emphasis> (in the Americas). The disease is characterized by infection of the macrophages sequestered within the reticuloendothelial system, including the bone marrow, but most impressively, it causes massive hepatosplenomegaly, resulting in a protruding abdomen. Both the liver and spleen are filled with amastigote-infected mononuclear cells. This results in defects in immune clearance that put patients at increased risk for a wide variety of bacterial infections. Additionally, because of infection in the bone marrow, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are key features of advanced disease. Finally, people in Sudan and India who have had visceral leishmaniasis caused by <emphasis>L. donovani</emphasis> may develop a condition known as post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib17">(17)</link>. There are numerous clinical manifestations of the syndrome, but the most common is the development of a macular, maculopapular, or nodular rash. For cases of Indian PKDL, treatment is always required, while in Sudan only severe or chronic cases require treatment. For an immunocompetent person with visceral leishmaniasis, treatment with liposomal amphotericin B is recommended <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib10">(10)</link>. For an immunocompetent person with visceral leishmaniasis caused by <emphasis>L. donovani</emphasis>, treatment with the oral agent miltefosine may be appropriate, depending on where the infection was acquired, age, and other patient demographics.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  The patient was infected by the bite of the sand fly, the vector for this organism. Essentially, all cases of cutaneous disease are obtained in this manner. Sand flies primarily feed at dawn and dusk, so it is during those periods that humans are most at risk. Leishmaniasis is primarily a zoonotic disease, with humans often being accidental hosts. This patient had several reasons for developing this infection. First, he slept in an open-air shelter without screens, greatly increasing his risk of sand fly bites. In his history, he admitted to having “countless” insect bites. He did not use any insect repellent, nor did he wear long-sleeved clothing. Using screens, insect repellent, and long-sleeved clothes is recommended to prevent leishmaniasis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  Most cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in the United States are related to travel or immigration, although cases caused by <emphasis>L. mexicana</emphasis> are considered endemic in the United States and have been reported from Texas and southeast Oklahoma over the last decade in individuals with no prior travel history (<link linkend="ch0044s0002bib11">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib18">18</link>). Three distinct populations in the United States and some other northern industrialized countries are at increased risk for the development of cutaneous leishmaniasis. They are (i) travelers, especially those who do adventure tourism, such as the patient described here; (ii) military or other personnel who are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan; and (iii) emigrants who return to visit family and friends in their native countries where the disease is endemic <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib19">(19)</link>. With the growing popularity of adventure tourism in the Amazon basin, cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis are on the rise in the industrialized north. With the return of most troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, the number of cases in those populations is declining. However, recent literature has suggested that various factors in the United States could contribute to increased cases of leishmaniasis, including climate change, the presence of competent vectors, immigration and returned military service members, and increased populations of transplant and immunosuppressed patients <link linkend="ch0044s0002bib18">(18)</link>.</para>
