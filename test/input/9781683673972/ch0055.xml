      <sect1 id="ch0055s0004"><title>CASE 52</title><para>The patient was a 27-year-old Caucasian male who was transferred from a hospital in eastern North Carolina, where he lived in a small rural town with his mother. He worked in hog processing as a meat inspector. He moved from Ohio to North Carolina approximately 3 years ago. He gave a rather vague and contradictory history concerning opioid use while in Ohio.</para>
      <para>One day prior to his transfer, he awoke with a severe headache and neck pain that prevented him from going to work. He felt better during the day, but the morning of his admission, he again awoke with a severe headache (the “worst of his life”) and presented to the emergency department (ED) of an outside hospital. A head computed tomography (CT) scan indicated an intracranial bleed. Because no neurosurgeon was available, he was transferred to a tertiary hospital where he was taken emergently to the operating room (OR). There a middle cerebral artery aneurysm was detected and repaired, with blood evacuated from the brain.</para>
      <para>On physical examination 2 days postsurgery, his vital signs were within normal limits, as were his complete blood count and metabolic panel. He denied fever; chills; night sweats; weight loss; or pain in his chest, abdomen, back, or joints prior to admission. He did not have any skin rashes, and his nail beds were normal. Importantly, on physical examination, he was noted to have a grade 3 over 6 systolic murmur coupled with poor dentition. When the systolic murmur was noted, he had a transthoracic echocardiogram that showed a large mitral valve vegetation. Two blood cultures were ordered, as well as HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C serologies. He was started on two antibiotics: vancomycin and ceftriaxone.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  A vegetation is a pathologic lesion seen in patients with endocarditis. The infection begins with a defect in one of the heart valves, resulting in turbulent blood flow. This may result in deposition of platelets and fibrin, to which “sticky” organisms may bind during a transient bacteremia. A common culprit is viridans group streptococci (VGS), which are predominant in dental plaque. As bacteria divide and increasing amounts of fibrin and platelets adhere, the vegetation grows until it can be visualized by echocardiogram.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  An increasing number of individuals have opioid use disorder in the United States, with high rates being reported in states along the Appalachian Mountains <link linkend="ch0055s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Initially the patients may have received long-acting opioids to treat pain. Unfortunately, the use of long-acting opioids often results in addiction to opioids. When addicted individuals can no longer obtain the drugs legally, they may turn to street drugs, especially heroin. These street drugs are frequently not sterile, and a variety of organisms can be associated with their injection. Alternatively, organisms can be introduced during injection secondary to licking the needle, contamination of fluids used to dissolve the street drugs, or injecting through a contaminated site. A significant increase in the number of endocarditis cases is being seen in this population <link linkend="ch0055s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Patients with poor dentition often develop transient bacteremia, especially when brushing teeth. The most common bacteria involved are members of the VGS. These organisms are an important component of dental plaque. VGS have polysaccharides on their surface that mediate adherence to the tooth surface as well as other organisms—these polysaccharides likely also mediate adherence to heart valves that have been damaged by injection of drugs, resulting in vegetations on the surface of the heart valve.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Patients who have endocarditis have “continuous bacteremia,” in that bacteria are constantly being shed from the heart valve and enter the bloodstream. In patients with endocarditis, all blood cultures will be positive. In some patients who have multiple blood cultures, only one may be positive for organisms that are part of the skin microbiota or can cause transient bacteremia following tooth brushing. Since VGS is among those organisms that might be found transiently, it is important to determine if the organism is present transiently or continuously. Patients with transient bacteremia or skin contamination will typically have only one of two positive blood cultures, while those with continuous bacteremia will have the same organism in both cultures.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Empiric therapy is treatment administered based on philosophy, experience, or prior knowledge, and is given when the specific cause of an infection is unknown. The choice of which antimicrobials to use is based on the likelihood that they will inhibit or kill the most common organisms expected to be the cause of the infection. In this case, the antibiotics chosen were vancomycin, which will kill most Gram-positive organisms, and ceftriaxone, which will kill most Gram-negative organisms that can cause endocarditis. A gap in empiric therapy would occur if the patient had vancomycin-resistant <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis>, or VRE. The most common species of VRE is <emphasis>Enterococcus faecium</emphasis>. Since <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> makes up only 10% of isolates that cause endocarditis in substance use disorder (SUD) and not all are E. faecium, the patient’s risk is small <link linkend="ch0055s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Two other organisms that would not be covered by this therapy are <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis> and <emphasis>Candida albicans</emphasis>, each of which is found in 5% of individuals with SUD-associated endocarditis <link linkend="ch0055s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The organism is most likely one of the VGS. VGS are Gram-positive cocci that are organized in pairs or short chains. Another possibility would be an <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> sp.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  VGS are reliably susceptible to both vancomycin and ceftriaxone. At this point, it would not be unreasonable to de-escalate the antimicrobial therapy to one of the two cell wall antimicrobials; which agent is preferred is difficult to say based on the evidence, although ceftriaxone tends to be more bactericidal against VGS compared with vancomycin.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  The most frequent mode of transmission of HCV is injection drug use, specifically, sharing a needle with an HCV-infected individual. Because opioid addiction is often not well documented in patient medical records, epidemiologic studies use HCV infection as a surrogate for SUD. The patient belongs to the demographic group most frequently associated with SUD: rural Caucasians between 18 and 44 years of age <link linkend="ch0055s0002bib04">(4)</link>. The most common cause of bacterial endocarditis in this group is <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>, frequently secondary to skin or soft tissue infections. In this case, the source of the bacteria that caused his infection was most likely his poor dentition. His prior drug use may have damaged his mitral valve, creating an abnormality on which a vegetation could form and the VGS could adhere.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  Optochin (ethylhydrocupreine hydrochloride) is a chemical that can be used to presumptively identify alpha hemolytic streptococci. All strains of VGS are resistant to optochin, while <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> is susceptible. Given that the organism was an optochin resistant, α-hemolytic, Gram-positive coccus in chains, the most likely identification is VGS. <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> spp. are occasionally α-hemolytic as well as vancomycin resistant, so a confirmatory identification was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The organism was identified as belonging to the <emphasis>Streptococcus sanguis</emphasis> group which are oral alpha hemolytic streptococci.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Since the organism is susceptible to both ceftriaxone and vancomycin, either one could be chosen based on current clinical practice guidelines. However, ceftriaxone dosing is less frequent and vancomycin requires monitoring for toxicity, so ceftriaxone was chosen. The consulting infectious disease team added 2 weeks of gentamicin to the patient’s therapy with the idea that gentamicin would be synergistic with ceftriaxone. Although Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) endocarditis clinical practice guidelines recommend the combination of penicillin and gentamicin, there is no recommendation for the use of gentamicin with ceftriaxone <link linkend="ch0055s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Again because of potential toxicity, gentamicin levels need to be monitored.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  Because the patient had a stroke secondary to his endocarditis, the ID consultant recommended the replacement of his mitral valve to reduce the risk of additional embolic events by removing the valve with vegetations that could embolize. In patients with stroke, valve replacement should be delayed for 4 weeks while the infection is being treated to minimize the risk of infectious emboli and contamination of the replacement valve.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">12.</emphasis>  The aneurysm was likely the result of a septic embolus in which a small fragment of infected tissue released from the vegetation on his heart valve and lodged in an artery, resulting in inflammation, ischemia, and weakening of the arterial wall resulting in blood leaking into tissue. Approximately 90% of septic emboli from the mitral valve lodge in the middle cerebral artery.</para>
