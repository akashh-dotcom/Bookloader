        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The CDC recommends that all pregnant women be screened at the initial prenatal visit for the following: syphilis, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and, for those under 25, both <emphasis>Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para>Syphilis detection is particularly important in pregnancy since cases of congenital syphilis in the United States increased more than 8-fold between 2012 and 2021<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Untreated syphilis can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant deaths, with these outcomes much more common in individuals in lower economic groups such as this migrant farm worker. Further complicating syphilis treatment in 2023 were shortages of penicillin G, the only recommended treatment of syphilis during pregnancy, due in part to increasing syphilis case numbers in the United States <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para>Women who are found to be positive for HIV, hepatitis C, or hepatitis B should be referred to an HIV care clinic where HIV and these two other viruses frequently associated with HIV can be managed in the context of pregnancy<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Access to this care may be limited for individuals who live in rural areas and are transient because of their employment.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  A troubling trend in health care in the United States is the ever-expanding “maternity care deserts” <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib05">(5)</link>. More than half of the rural counties in the United States do not have maternal health services despite having a population of 28 million women of childbearing age (<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib06">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib07">7</link>). The inability of women living in rural areas, especially those of lower socioeconomic status, to access prenatal care has resulted in the United States having one of the highest maternal death rates among high-income nations <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib05">(5)</link>. This, coupled with a 3% increase in infant death rate in 2022, reversed a trend of declining rates since 1995 <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Increased neonatal infections is a key factor in this increased rate.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women who have premature rupture of membranes, are in labor, have a temperature &gt;38°C, and whose group B <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> (GBS) colonization status is unknown receive prophylactic antimicrobials <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib09">(9)</link>. The drug of choice is IV penicillin G. As previously noted, penicillin G was in short supply in the United States at the time of this case. IV ampicillin is an effective alternative and is widely used as intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis (IAP) because surveys of antimicrobial resistance in GBS strains have shown them to be uniformly susceptible <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib09">(9)</link>. It must be given intravenously since neither oral nor intramuscular administration is effective for IAP. The target organism for this prophylaxis is GBS, which colonizes the genitourinary tract in 10 to 30% of pregnant women, which can lead to chorioamnionitis. More importantly, vertical transmission of the organism from colonized or infected women to their fetus/infant can lead to pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in the newborn. The goal of this prophylaxis is to prevent this transmission. </para>
        <para>In women who are allergic to penicillin, intravenous clindamycin is the drug of choice<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib09">(9)</link>. This choice is somewhat problematic because up to 40% of GBS strains may be resistant to clindamycin <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Cefazolin is another beta-lactam to which GBS is reliably susceptible. It is recommended in women who have mild penicillin allergies, but distinguishing between mild and severe allergies can be complicated (<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib09">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib11">11</link>). Finally, GBS is uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. It is another recommended alternative for GBS prophylaxis. One small study found that vancomycin and clindamycin were used at a similar rate prophylactically in GBS-positive mothers who reported penicillin allergies but only rarely in nonallergic ones <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib12">(12)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Apgar score is based on five observations done at 1 and 5 minutes after birth to determine the clinical status of a newborn. The five observations are skin color, heart rate, reflexes, muscle tone, and respiration. Each is scored as 0, 1, or 2 based on well-established criteria <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib13">(13)</link>. The child's Apgar scores of 2 and 4 indicate a child in cardiopulmonary distress. A common cause of poor Apgar scores is asphyxia, a leading cause of death in premature infants <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Pulmonary disease and sepsis are important causes of asphyxia. Because of the child's poor Apgar scores, the infant was intubated, and blood and tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained to determine if the infant's distress was due to infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  The organisms seen in <link linkend="ch0047s0004fg01">Fig. 44.1</link> are Gram-positive cocci in pairs and short chains. In a premature infant in respiratory distress (remember the Apgar scores), the most likely organism is GBS. GBS is an encapsulated, weakly beta-hemolytic, facultative anaerobic, with Gram-positive cocci in pairs and short chains consistent with <link linkend="ch0047s0004fg01">Fig. 44.1</link> and <link linkend="ch0047s0004fg01">44.2</link>. It is the leading cause of neonate pneumonia and sepsis. Another organism that is a possible cause of neonatal pneumonia and sepsis is <emphasis>Listeria monocytogenes</emphasis>. It is a short, Gram-positive rod but can be confused with GBS. Outbreaks of <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> in Latinx populations can occur due to consumption of soft cheese called queso fresco when made with unpasteurized cow milk (<ulink url="ch0046.xml#ch0046">case 43</ulink>) <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Vertical transmission (mother to fetus/infant) of this organism is well documented during pregnancy and can result in stillbirth or premature birth complicated by neonatal sepsis <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib16">(16)</link>. The primary treatment of choice is the same as that for GBS, IV penicillin G or ampicillin. However, the beta-lactam alternative for GBS in a pregnant woman with mild penicillin allergies, cefazolin, is not active against <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> and should not be used in either the mother or infant. When <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> infection is confirmed in pregnant women with penicillin allergy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the antimicrobial of choice <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib17">(17)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Both GBS and <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> will grow in blood cultures. Both organisms' colonial morphology is consistent with the organism seen in <link linkend="ch0047s0004fg01">Fig. 44.2</link>—grayish white colonies with a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis. However, the two organisms can be easily differentiated by doing a catalase test. The catalase test is rapid and easily performed. A colony or two are transferred to a glass slide and a drop of hydrogen peroxide is added to the organism. The immediate evolution of bubbling indicates that the enzyme, catalase, is present in the organism. The reaction that occurs is the degradation of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen gas, thus the bubbling. <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> is catalase positive and GBS is negative. Additional testing would need to be done to determine if the catalase-positive organism is in fact <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> and the catalase-negative organism is GBS. Colonies of both organisms can be rapidly identified with a high degree of accuracy by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib10">(10)</link>. This technology is widely available in clinical laboratories serving neonatal intensive care units.</para>

        <para>Current understanding of the pathogenesis of GBS EOD is that the child becomes infected either<emphasis>in utero</emphasis> (GBS infection is an important cause of <emphasis>in utero</emphasis> demise and stillbirths) or via aspiration of the organism from amniotic fluid during labor or passage through the birth canal <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib18">(18)</link>. In premature infants, the lungs are the last organism system to develop, and it is speculated that opsonic neutrophil-mediated defenses are not as well developed in premature, low-birthweight infants <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib18">(18)</link>. As a result, the initial site of infection is the lungs; the organism can enter the bloodstream, resulting in sepsis. Approximately 10% will develop bacterial meningitis. IV penicillin G or ampicillin is recommended with dosages based on weight <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib18">(18)</link>. The addition of aminoglycoside is recommended in neonates ≤7 days old.

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Current understanding of the pathogenesis is that the neonate is infected sometime after birth<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Since LOD is more common in neonates who are born to GBS-positive mothers, it is likely they become infected from their mothers. Pneumonia is not common with LOD, with bacteremia without a focus of infection being the most common form of GBS LOD <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Although our understanding of the events that lead to bacterial meningitis is improving, why GBS LOD is more likely to result in meningitis is unclear <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Recommendations for treatment of GBS meningitis are similar to those for GBS EOD, although some authors advocate the addition of ceftriaxone in combination with penicillin G or ampicillin <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib19">(19)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Between 2006 and 2015, the rate of GBS EOD declined from 0.37 per 1,000 live births to 0.23 <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib20">(20)</link>. This continues a trend that began in 1993 when the rate of GBS EOD was 1.7 per 1,000 live births <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib21">(21)</link>. The reason for this remarkable improvement was the standardization and widespread GBS screening of pregnant women and the use of IAP in women colonized with GBS. By comparison, the rate of GBS LOD has remained unchanged at a mean of 0.31 per 1,000 live births <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib20">(20)</link>. IAP does not protect infants from LOD <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib18">(18)</link>.</para>
        <para role="listPara1">Approximately 10 to 30% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS in either the rectum or vagina<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib09">(9)</link>. The strategy is to screen them between 36 0/7 weeks and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation for GBS colonization of the vagina and rectum. A single swab, preferably flocked, is first introduced approximately 2 cm into the vagina and then approximately 1 cm beyond the anal sphincter <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib10">(10)</link>. This method is more sensitive than collecting two swabs, one each from the vagina and rectum. Self-collection of specimens is acceptably accurate. The swab should be placed in liquid transport medium, which is widely available commercially, and transported to the laboratory. Within 24 hours of collection, the swab should be incubated in a selective broth for 18 to 24 hours. This broth is then subcultured to a blood agar plate or tested for the presence of GBS using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib10">(10)</link>. It is recommended that susceptibility testing be done on GBS isolates from women who are known to be penicillin allergic since clindamycin is the drug of choice in that population and clindamycin resistance is common in GBS <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib10">(10)</link>. The laboratory should use methods that detect both constitutive and inducible clindamycin resistance (see <ulink url="ch0037.xml#ch0037">case 34</ulink>).</para>
        <para role="listPara1">In addition, pregnant women have increased rates of urinary tract infection. The presence of any amount of GBS in urine (bacteriuria) indicates that a woman is colonized with GBS<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib10">(10)</link>. It is recommended that a system be in place to notify the clinicians that a pregnant woman has GBS bacteriuria. She would be a candidate for GBS IAP.</para>
        <para role="listPara1">Another population of pregnant women who are candidates for GBS IAP are those who previously delivered an infant or stillborn baby with GBS disease<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib09">(9)</link>.</para>
        <para role="listPara1">In women who have not been screened for GBS prior to labor, an alternative GBS screening approach is to perform GBS NAAT on a vaginal-rectal swab<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib09">(9)</link>. This method is not as sensitive as performing NAAT after broth enrichment. Additionally, to be most useful, testing must be available 24/7. Such test capability may not be widely available.</para>
        <para role="listPara1">This mother did not receive routine prenatal care in the third trimester, likely due to limited access in a rural maternity desert. Second, she went into labor at 31 weeks of gestation, long before GBS screening is recommended. Finally, she was treated with an antimicrobial, ampicillin, that is used for IAP. Unfortunately, based on her clinical presentation, she was likely infected with GBS and likely had already infected her infant.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>   Currently there are several conjugated GBS capsular vaccines under development <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib22">(22)</link>. The proposed strategy for the deployment of this vaccine would be to vaccinate pregnant women at between 28 and 35 weeks of gestation to provide transplacental antibodies to the infant. Such an approach has been successful in reducing cases of neonatal tetanus <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib22">(22)</link>. A phase 1/2 trial in pregnant women vaccinated with a candidate conjugate multivalent-capsular GBS vaccine showed that the vaccine was safe and that GBS antibody levels were elevated in infants born to vaccinated mothers compared to infants born to women who had not received the vaccine <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib23">(23)</link>. These studies have relatively small numbers of subjects, making them “proof of principle” studies. To determine the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing neonatal GBS infections, much larger and far more expensive phase 3 clinical trials would be necessary. Thus far, no phase 3 studies have been undertaken.</para>
        <para role="listPara1">Although the World Health Organization sees GBS vaccination during pregnancy as a potential strategy to prevent both EOD and LOD due to GBS, vaccine makers have been reluctant to perform these studies because of a relatively small market for this vaccine in high-income countries where revenue from the vaccine would be limited. For example, approximately 1% of the U. S. population, pregnant women, would be candidates to receive a GBS vaccine each year<link linkend="ch0047s0002bib24">(24)</link>. Vaccine refusal is common in pregnant women, further limiting the revenue from the development of such a vaccine <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib25">(25)</link>. In much of the world, GBS screening followed by IAP is not available to reduce the likelihood of GBS EOD. GBS vaccination during pregnancy in low-income countries would have the potential to reduce both the frequency and mortality associated with neonatal GBS infections <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib22">(22)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  The adult population that is most likely to have infections with GBS is individuals over 60 years of age with diabetes <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib26">(26)</link>. The organism is frequently recovered from diabetic foot ulcers and osteomyelitis secondary to those ulcers, contributing to amputations in this patient population. Peripheral vascular disease secondary to diabetes is an important risk factor for “diabetic” foot. It may also cause cellulitis, urosepsis, and bacteremia in this group as well. Patients with liver cirrhosis and malignancy are also at risk for invasive GBS disease. Finally, patients living in skilled nursing facilities, including memory care units, are at increased risk for GBS sepsis secondary to pneumonia or urinary tract infections <link linkend="ch0047s0002bib26">(26)</link>.</para>

            <para>GBS is an encapsulated, facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive coccus. On Gram stain, it appears as diplococci or in short chains. It is catalase negative, and on sheep blood agar, colonies produce a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0047s0003x45">
            <para>GBS colonizes the genitourinary tract in 10 to 30% of pregnant women. In those women, GBS vertical transmission to the fetus/infant frequently occurs. Depending on the stage of pregnancy, this may result in stillbirth or neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, or meningitis.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0047s0003x46">
            <para>There are two forms of neonatal GBS infection, EOD and LOD.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0047s0003x47">
            <para>EOD occurs most frequently at 1 to 2 days of life. The children are typically premature and are born to mothers with prolonged premature labor. The organism is likely obtained either<emphasis>in utero</emphasis> or during labor by aspiration of GBS-contaminated amniotic or vaginal fluid. These infants have signs and symptoms of asphyxia as evidenced by poor 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores. Pneumonia and sepsis are common; mortality is high.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0047s0003x48">
            <para>LOD occurs at 7 to 89 days of life. Only about half of these children are premature. These patients are less likely to have pneumonia but more likely to develop meningitis but have a lower mortality. IAP is not protective against this form of disease. It is now the more common form of neonatal GBS infection.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0047s0003x49">
            <para>Vaginal-rectal GBS screening in pregnant women at 36 0/7 weeks to 37 6/7 weeks and then IAP in GBS-positive mothers reduces GBS EOD rates. Mothers who have had GBS bacteriuria or a previous child with GBS should also receive IAP.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0047s0003x50">
            <para>IV penicillin G or ampicillin is recommended for IAP. GBS is reliably susceptible to these agents. In penicillin-allergic mothers, IV clindamycin (when susceptible) is recommended. When GBS isolates are resistant, vancomycin is recommended for IAP.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0047s0003x51">
            <para>GBS multivalent conjugated vaccines have gone through phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. They are safe and may be protective. The vaccine strategy, to vaccinate the mother with a vaccine to protect the fetus/infant by transplacental transfer of antibodies, has been found to be effective in preventing neonatal tetanus. The small population to be vaccinated and vaccine hesitancy/refusal may explain why phase 3 trials have not occurred.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0047s0003x52">
            <para>GBS can also cause serious infections in patients over age 60 with diabetes, those with cirrhosis of the liver or malignancy, and those living in skilled nursing facilities.</para>
