      <para>Three weeks later, the patient had the onset of loose, watery stools, which increased in frequency to &gt;10 times/day. She developed fecal incontinence and had to wear an adult diaper. She also had generalized weakness, diffuse abdominal pain, inability to walk, and inability to eat, with several episodes of nausea and vomiting. On readmission to the hospital, approximately 3 weeks into her diarrheal disease course, she exhibited fever, chills, malaise, myalgias, and dizziness. She had a 5-lb weight loss since her prior admission. She continued to have shortness of breath but no cough. Physical examination was significant for a pulse of 120 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 24/minute, and blood pressure of 82/45 mm Hg. On examination, her abdomen was soft, diffusely tender, and mildly distended with no rebound or guarding. She had decreased bowel sounds. Her stool was negative for occult blood. Laboratory data were significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 29,000/μl. A stool specimen was sent to the microbiology laboratory for <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> testing.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The Gram stain shows polymorphonuclear WBCs consistent with acute inflammation and Gram-positive cocci in pairs with clear areas surrounding many of the cocci. Those clear areas are consistent with polysaccharide capsule, which does not take up either stain used in the Gram stain. The most common encapsulated Gram-positive coccus causing pneumonia is <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>. The typical radiographic finding in patients with <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> pneumonia is the presence of infiltrates in a single lobe or lobar pneumonia. Given the Gram stain and chest radiograph finding, the patient is likely to have pneumococcal pneumonia.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The 2019 American Thoracic Society clinical practice guidelines recommend oral levofloxacin in mild cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in people with chronic lung disease <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment due to an increased risk of being infected with drug-resistant organisms due to previous contact with the health care system including hospitals and LTCFs, and antibiotic exposure. In this particular care, levofloxacin is recommended because of concern that people with chronic lung disease are more likely to have been treated with antimicrobial agents previously and thus are more likely to be infected with organisms resistant to more narrow-spectrum orally administered antimicrobials such as amoxicillin and azithromycin, so the choice of antimicrobial agent, levofloxacin, was appropriate. The current length of therapy recommended for CAP is 5 days using a daily dose of 750 mg. There are caveats to the duration of therapy based on the patient’s clinical response, but the patient’s extended course of 14 days was not consistent with current recommendations. The goal of antimicrobial stewardship programs is to make sure that the patient is getting the right antimicrobial at the right dose for the right amount of time <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The desired outcomes of these programs are better clinical outcomes; better use of resources (antimicrobial expense is a significant portion of any health care system’s pharmaceutical budget); reduction of antimicrobial resistance; and reduction of adverse events associated with antimicrobial administration, especially <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  During a traditional “respiratory” season (roughly November through March in the industrialized Northern Hemisphere), testing for influenza viruses is recommended, especially in those with chronic lung disease <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib01">(1)</link>.

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  The patient’s stool was positive for toxigenic <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>. The presence of the organism was detected by a rapid immunochromatographic test, which uses antibodies specific for the two analytes, Ag and Tox. The Ag analyte is glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), a cell wall antigen that is produced abundantly by the organism. The Tox analyte is <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> toxins A and B. The test may detect the presence of both or one of the toxins. When both analytes are positive, the patient is considered to have <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection. Most strains of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> produce both toxins; however, mutations in the area of the genome that encodes the two toxin genes may result in strains that produce only toxin A or neither toxin. Strains that do not produce either toxin are not pathogenic, since toxin activity is central to the pathogenicity of the organism. Then why are both analytes used; why not only test for toxin? The reason is that small amounts of toxins can cause disease but may be too low to detect using this method. Inclusion of the GDH antigen increases sensitivity for the presence of the organism, enabling the performance of molecular testing to determine if toxin genes are in the sample.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends that a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> toxin gene(s) be done in the setting of a positive GDH but negative toxin test <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Why not use the <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> NAAT as a stand-alone test? In fact, some laboratories do a stand-alone <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> NAAT <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib08">(8)</link>. There is little disagreement that <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> NAATs are highly sensitive <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib09">(9)</link>. The area of disagreement is that false positives may occur with <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> NAATs because actively growing organisms, although necessary for disease, are not necessary for a positive NAAT. In addition, it is known that patients can carry <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> asymptomatically and these asymptomatic patients can have a positive <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> NAAT. The combination of GDH and <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> NAAT tests supports the idea that an actively growing organism is present (GDH-positive component) and that the organism is a toxin producer [NAAT detection of toxin gene(s)]. The algorithmic approach of a GDH toxin antigen test with a toxin gene NAAT to resolve the GDH-positive/toxin-negative results is used because it is significantly cheaper than a NAAT-only approach <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib10">(10)</link>. However, if preanalytical approaches are used to ensure that testing is being performed on patients who have clinical course consistent with <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> (diarrhea, no laxative use, fever, and increased WBC count), the use of NAAT as a stand-alone diagnostic tool is sufficient and possibly more practical than an algorithmic approach <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib08">(8)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Based on the 2021 IDSA Focused Update Guidelines on management for <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> infection in adults, oral vancomycin is an acceptable treatment for this infection, having very low systemic absorption and acting primarily within the gastrointestinal lumen <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib07">(7)</link>. However, fidaxomicin is now the recommended treatment of choice for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection. The major reason is that <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> recurrences are less likely with fidaxocmicin.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> recurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Recurrences are most common in patients over 65 because they are less likely to make neutralizing antibodies to <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> toxins postinfection, have microbiota that are more susceptible to C. difficile, and tend to be hospitalized or in congregant living settings where acquisition of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection is more common <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib12">(12)</link>.</para>
        <para>Beyond antimicrobial therapy, including antimicrobial tapers, a monoclonal antibody against <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> toxin B, bezlotoxumab, is recommended as a co-intervention for treating recurrent <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infections <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Bezlotoxumab acts by blocking the activity of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> toxin B, a key virulence factor in the pathogenesis of this disease. It has a prolonged half-life of 18 days, with measurable levels up to 3 months postinfusion <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para>One of the challenges in treating <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> recurrences is that both fidaxomicin and vancomycin, the treatments of choice for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> recurrences, are active against the vegetative cells but not the spores of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>. At the conclusion of antimicrobial therapy, C. difficile spores may still be present in the colon of the patient. The colonic microbiota may lack organisms that protect from <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection by metabolizing primary bile salts to secondary ones. These secondary bile salts inhibit the growth of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>. Eliminating microbes that metabolize the primary bile salts from the colonic microbiota results in a condition known as dysbiosis. Recurrence of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection is likely due to presence of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> spores either in the gut or obtained from the individual’s environment. An idea that has found favor is to reconstitute the protective colonic flora as a means of preventing further recurrence of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>The initial approach to do so involved fecal microbiota transplants using donor stools introduced into the gut either by nasogastric tubes or colonoscopy<link linkend="ch0028s0002bib13">(13)</link>. This approach, although successful, was not standardized, and the safety of the technique was questioned. Because of these concerns, it remained an investigational tool not widely available. The development of a novel FDA-approved therapeutic that delivers a variety of bacteria by oral capsule able to repopulate the gut is highly effective in treating <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> recurrences <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib13">(13, 14</link>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> is a spore-forming bacterium. Spores are structures that do not actively reproduce but remain dormant and viable for months to years. Under proper environmental conditions, spores can “vegetate” into bacterial forms that can reproduce, multiply, and synthesize toxins. Key strategies for containing the spread of the bacteria are wearing disposable gowns and gloves when entering the room of infected individuals and removing them on departing, as well as handwashing with soap and water since spores are resistant to alcohol, the antimicrobial component of most hand disinfectants <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib15">(15)</link>. In addition, spores are frequently found in “high-touch” areas in infected patients’ rooms, especially on bedrails, over-bed tables, sinks, and commodes <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Terminal cleaning of rooms on discharge of infected patients should be done with a 10% bleach solution. A recent study showed that the combination of terminal cleaning with a 10% bleach solution with a UV light device used to inactivate spores improved the effectiveness of room decontamination of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0028s0002bib15">(15)</link>.</para>

They can survive in the environment for months and may be found in abundance in a room occupied by an infected individual, enabling their spread in the health care setting. Spores can also survive in the gut of individuals treated with antimicrobials and may result in recurrent infection after antimicrobial therapy.</para>

            <para>Diagnosis of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection is dependent on the detection of either toxin protein or toxin genes in the stools of infected individuals. Culture is not done for this bacterium for diagnostic purposes. An algorithmic approach of antigen and NAAT testing is often used. When NAATs are used as stand-alone tests, strict preanalytic criteria should be met to avoid false-positive results, leading to unnecessary treatment and patient isolation.</para>
