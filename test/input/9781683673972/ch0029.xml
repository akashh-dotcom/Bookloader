        <para>The patient was a 15-year-old boy who presented to his local pediatrician with acute onset of rectal pain. On the morning of his presentation, he noticed that he passed what he described as a yellow “string” of about 4 feet in length in his stool. This “string” was not associated with either blood or pus. Residual “string” was stuck in his anus, and when the patient tried to pull it, it caused severe lower left quadrant abdominal pain. With his mother out of the room, the patient denied ingesting anything unusual and adamantly denied inserting anything in his anus or any kind of sexual contact.</para>
        <para>On physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits. An anal examination revealed the presence of a 50-cm-long rubbery, segmented string extruding from his anus. The patient reported pain when the object was pulled. It was extracted from the anus and sent for microbiologic examination, the results of which are seen in <link linkend="ch0029s0001fg02">Fig. 26.1</link> and <link linkend="ch0029s0001fg02">26.2</link>.</para>

          <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The organism extracted from the patient’s anus was a flat, wide, segmented worm most consistent with a tapeworm. In addition, the segments of the worm were quite wide, which makes this most consistent with the tapeworm <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Dibothriocephalus latus </emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis>(1). <emphasis>Latus</emphasis> is the Latin word for “broad” or “wide.”</para>
          <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The structure of a tapeworm is simple, with a head, the scolex, attached to many segments that appear rectangular, called proglottids. Proglottids contain both sexual organs and are egg-producing machines making hundreds of thousands of eggs per worm per day <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib02">(2)</link>. This tapeworm species grows rapidly in humans and may grow by more than a meter in a week. Worms can grow to be as long as 15 meters in the human intestine, but most are much shorter than that <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib02">(2)</link>. The segments may also break off and be passed, appearing like rice grains in feces. The segment that was crushed was a proglottid. When a gravid proglottid is crushed, eggs are released. The size (45 by 65 μm) and shape of the egg seen in <link linkend="ch0029s0001fg02">Fig. 26.2</link> are consistent with <emphasis>D. latus</emphasis>. A key feature of the eggs of this worm is the operculum, which is difficult to appreciate in <link linkend="ch0029s0001fg02">Fig. 26.2</link>. The operculum is on the end of the egg and is the site where the initial larval stage emerges from the egg.</para>

          <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Humans are the definitive host for <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>D. latus</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis>, which means a human is the host in which parasite reproduction occurs <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib02">(2)</link>. The life cycle of <emphasis>D. latus</emphasis> is complex (see <link linkend="ch0029s0002fg04">Fig. 26.4</link>). Eggs are produced and fertilized in the proglottids. These eggs are released from the worm and passed in feces. The eggs hatch in freshwater and the larvae are ingested by copepods (small crustaceans), which are the first intermediate host of this parasite. In the crustaceans, the parasite develops into a stage called the procercoid. When the infected crustacean is ingested by a freshwater or anadromous fish, the procercoid enters the tissue of the fish and develops into the plerocercoid phase. This phase, when ingested by humans in uncooked or undercooked fish flesh, develops into the adult tapeworm, where the cycle can begin again.</para>
          <para>There are two other tapeworms that are common in humans: the pig tapeworm,<emphasis>Taenia solium</emphasis>, and the bovine tapeworm, <emphasis>Taenia saginata</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0029s0003bib03">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib04">4</link>). Humans can be both the definitive and intermediate host for <emphasis>T. solium</emphasis> but only the definitive host for <emphasis>T. saginata</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib03">(3)</link>. The determining factor in whether humans are an intermediate or definitive host for <emphasis>T. solium</emphasis> is the stage of the ingested parasite. If eggs excreted by humans are ingested, the patient is an intermediate host, and the disease process that develops is called cysticercosis <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib03">(3)</link>. If <emphasis>T. solium</emphasis> cysts are ingested by eating raw or undercooked pork, then the individual is the definitive host, and an adult tapeworm results. The common parlance for all three tapeworms depends upon the name of the intermediate host from which the human host becomes infected.</para>

          <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  All these forms of fish are eaten uncooked, which allows the plerocercoid larval stage to survive and infect the human. The larval stage can be killed in one of two ways <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib05">(5)</link>. One is by cooking it to 55 °C for 5 minutes; the other is to freeze the fish at –20 °C for 1 week or –35 °C for 1 day. Unfortunately, most individuals who eat sushi, sashimi, or other types of raw fish prefer the texture of unfrozen fish.</para>
          <para>Many freshwater lake fish have been found to be infected with this parasite, including pike, perch, burbot, and walleye<link linkend="ch0029s0003bib05">(5)</link>. In certain European locales, as many as 15% of the lake fish are infected with this organism. <emphasis>D. latus</emphasis> is also common in anadromous fish, which are fish that swim upriver in order to spawn in freshwater <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib05">(5)</link>. The key anadromous fish that are infected with <emphasis>D. latus</emphasis> and can cause human infection are the different species of salmon. Both trout and whitefish also can be a source of this infection.</para>
          <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Most individuals do not realize they are infected with <emphasis>D. latum</emphasis> unless they see passed proglottids in the feces. In this case, the individual likely had the worm in his large bowel, which explained the pain he felt when the physician tried to extract the worm. A single dose of praziquantel is sufficient to purge the worm <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib05">(5)</link>. Most patients are asymptomatic, but those with a high worm burden may experience gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and discomfort. Probably the most severe complication of <emphasis>D. latus</emphasis> infection in patients with a high worm burden is pernicious anemia. Anemia is a result of a parasite-induced vitamin B<subscript>12</subscript> deficiency. It is estimated that the worms absorb 100 times more B<subscript>12</subscript> than the host, and if the worm burden is high enough, this can result in B<subscript>12</subscript> deficiency <link linkend="ch0029s0003bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
