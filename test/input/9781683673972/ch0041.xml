      <para>One year later, the woman again presented with pain, erythema, and swelling, now in her right breast. Multiple abscesses were noted and 7 ml of pus was aspirated from these lesions. Gram stain of pus revealed 3+ neutrophils, but no organisms were seen. The aspirate culture grew the same organism that caused the infection of her left breast. Over the next 4 months the patient did not improve despite a variety of antimicrobial regimens that included dicloxacillin, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and ciprofloxacin; a course of prednisone; two ultrasound-guided aspirations; and two incisions and drainages. Despite long-term oral antimicrobial therapy and intensive aspirations and surgical debridement, she continued to be symptomatic, culture positive, and have acute and chronic breast tissue inflammation by histopathology. The patient was referred to an infectious disease specialist, who recommended 8 weeks of linezolid.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The woman’s clinical condition is called mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast, most commonly found in lactating women and is associated with blocked or engorged milk ducts <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The incidence of mastitis in lactating women ranges between 2 and 30% globally but is less common in industrialized countries. In nonlactating women, the disease process can be confused with malignancy, but breast imaging and histopathology can be used to differentiate abscess from malignancy. Mastitis is typically due to members of the skin microbiota, with <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> being the most common <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The presence of both neutrophils and a Gram-positive bacillus described as having a “diphtheroid” morphology (<link linkend="ch0041s0004fg01">Fig. 38.1</link>A) in the breast aspirate suggests that there was an infectious process causing her symptoms.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The most common diphtheroid-like organism recovered from clinical specimens is <emphasis>Cutibacterium acnes</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib02">(2)</link>. This aerotolerant, anaerobic, Gram-positive “diphtheroid” is a major component of the skin microbiota. It is a frequent contaminant of blood, CSF, and aspirate cultures. Any culture collected by puncturing the skin with a needle has the potential risk of being contaminated with this organism even if the skin is properly disinfected using an appropriate disinfectant such as chlorhexidine or iodine <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib03">(3)</link>. The reason is that <emphasis>C. acnes</emphasis> is found deep in skin pores, and disinfectants may not penetrate there. When skin is punctured with a needle, a small bit of the skin may be present in cultured blood, CSF, or aspirate, and if there are viable organisms on this tissue, they can contaminate the culture. As a result, 3% or more of blood cultures may be contaminated with this organism or another skin organism, coagulase-negative <emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis>. When recovered from CSF, it is almost never clinically significant outside the setting of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib04">(4)</link>. As a result, diphtheroid-like organisms are often dismissed as contaminants when reported on a Gram stain. However, the combination of inflammation (presence of neutrophils) and the presence of many diphtheroid-like organisms on Gram stain suggests that this organism may be clinically significant.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii</emphasis> is now recognized as an important cause of granulomatous mastitis <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib05">(5)</link>. It is a facultative, Gram-positive, “diphtheroid-like” bacillus that is slow-growing on most commonly used isolation media such as 5% sheep blood agar (<link linkend="ch0041s0004fg01">Fig. 38.1</link>B). This slow growth is due to the lipophilic nature of the organism. Because cultures from breast tissue or aspirate cultures may only be incubated for 48 to 72 hours, this slow-growing organism may not be recovered from these specimens <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Supplementation of media with Tween 80 will enhance growth but is not routinely used in cultures from breast lesions <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para>The use of both 16S rRNA gene sequencing and particularly matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has simplified and improved the accuracy of identification of diphtheroid-like organisms<link linkend="ch0041s0002bib04">(4)</link>. This improvement in the identification of diphtheroid-like organisms to the species level has led to the recognition of a pathogenic role of several species in the <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> genus, including <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The lesion seen in this patient is termed a cystic neutrophilic granuloma. The central nonstaining space is a lipid-filled vacuole surrounded by neutrophils, with histiocytes forming the granuloma. Based on this pathology, the disease is called cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis (CNGM) <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib05">(5)</link>. In a series that used robust culture methods, 14-day culture incubation, and Tween 80-supplemented medium, <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> was detected in all 15 CNGM patients; 9 patients had <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis> detected, 8 by culture and 1 by 16S rRNA gene sequencing directly from tissue <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Identification to the species level was not performed on the other six cultures, which also grew a <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> species. A second study found Gram-positive bacilli by tissue Gram stain in the central vacuole of 16 of 19 CNGM patients, but culture correlation was not adequately described in this study <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib07">(7)</link>. The recovery of <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis> in the setting of CNGM indicates that the patient’s clinical disease was due to this organism.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Because <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis> CNGM is a newly recognized infection, there is a limited understanding of the virulence of this organism and the pathogenesis of CNGM. Because <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis> is lipophilic, it has tropism for breast tissue, which is lipid dense. The finding of this organism in lipid-filled vacuoles then is consistent with the organism’s metabolic needs. It is speculated that this organism grows in a biofilm in breast tissues. Organisms that grow as biofilms are difficult to treat and frequently demonstrate clinical resistance <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Clinical resistance is defined as an organism not responding to an antimicrobial to which the organism is susceptible by laboratory testing.</para>
        <para>Because of <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis>’s lipophilic nature, hydrophilic antimicrobials such as beta-lactams and tetracycline may not penetrate lipid-filled vacuoles where the organism grows <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Its ability to grow as a biofilm further complicates antimicrobial therapy. Because organisms grow slowly in biofilms, beta-lactams, which rely on the organism's growth to be bactericidal, are poorly effective against organisms with this mode of growth. These factors may explain why the initially chosen antimicrobials were not clinically active. Clindamycin is lipophilic but is not bactericidal and, as a result, may have limited activity in organisms growing in biofilms.</para>
        <para>Two factors may explain why symptoms improved when her therapy was changed. First, doxycycline is a lipophilic antimicrobial and therefore is better able to penetrate the lipid-filled vacuole<link linkend="ch0041s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid likely did not play a significant therapeutic role because it is hydrophilic and therefore not likely to reach therapeutic levels at the site of infection. Second, prolonged therapy also played a role. The recommended treatment duration for most skin and soft tissue infections is 5 to 14 days <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib10">(10)</link>. However, because of the organism’s lipophilic nature, prolonged therapy is recommended, although no clear data exist for the length of “prolonged therapy.” (See the <phrase>answer to question 9</phrase> for further discussion.)</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Unfortunately, it was not. In one of the larger case series of <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis>-associated mastitis, a third of patients had a recurrence of infection, with some having multiple recurrences <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib11">(11)</link>. In another smaller series, women with CNGM had an average of four surgical debridements <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib09">(9)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Linezolid is a synthetic antimicrobial belonging to the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib12">(12)</link>. It inhibits protein synthesis in Gram-positive organisms but lacks efficacy against most Gram-negative ones. It is FDA approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections due to Gram-positive organisms. It can be administered either parenterally or orally. When given orally, it has high tissue bioavailability. It is used primarily to treat vancomycin-resistant enterococcal and methicillin-resistant <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> infections. Because it is lipophilic, it has been used to treat <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis> CNGM <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib09">(9)</link>. How effective it is in this setting is an open question, especially since it is a bacteriostatic antimicrobial <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Patient compliance and cost are always of concern with any long-term antimicrobial treatment regimen. As with any therapeutic agent, there may be potential serious complications of linezolid treatment, the most serious of which are myelosuppression, peripheral and optic nerve neuropathy, and serotonin syndrome in patients receiving serotonergic agents <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib13">(13)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  No robust clinical trials have investigated how to treat this infection. In addition, there are no animal models of this infection to provide experimental data to support the use of specific therapeutic agents. Without these data, there can be no evidence-based treatment recommendations <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Right now, three treatment approaches are used <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib06">(6)</link>. The most common approach is antimicrobial therapy. Unfortunately, there is no real clear understanding of what antimicrobial class or classes might be effective nor the appropriate duration of therapy. However, it is speculated that long-term, lipophilic antimicrobials are likely to be more effective <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib06">(6)</link>. This is a frequent occurrence in infectious diseases because clinical trials to determine the optimal antimicrobial therapy for newly discovered organisms are complex and very expensive to conduct, and it may take years to accumulate enough study subjects to get sufficient statistical power to justify treatment recommendations. The second approach is surgical removal of infected tissue, but when, how much, and how effective is it? Finally, immunomodulatory therapy, specifically corticosteroids, is used to treat the inflammation that leads to the pain and swelling associated with this infection. Again, it is unknown if it is effective or may have long-term adverse effects that perhaps make the clinical course worse. How these three treatment modalities should be used in concert is unknown. Clearly, this patient’s complex clinical course demonstrated that there are no clear answers to how to manage <emphasis>C. kroppenstedtii</emphasis>-associated CNGM successfully.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  The most important human pathogen in the <emphasis>Corynebacterium</emphasis> genus is <emphasis>C. diphtheriae</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib15">(15)</link>. The pathogenicity of this organism is based on the organism’s ability to produce an A (for “active”) and B (for “binding”) subunit exotoxin called diphtheria toxin (DT) <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib15">(15)</link>. The B subunit binds the toxin to the host cell. It contains a membrane insertion component that allows the endocytosis of the toxin molecule into the cell. The A subunit is released from the endosome, where it ribosylates elongation factor 2, which prevents it from elongating the peptide chain, thus blocking protein synthesis and ultimately resulting in cell death. Toxigenic <emphasis>C. diphtheriae</emphasis> causes a localized pharyngeal infection characterized by the formation of a pseudomembrane, a thick, gray coating seen in the pharynx. The exotoxin is secreted from the bacteria, damaging tissue locally where it can enter and spread through the bloodstream, particularly to the heart, where it damages myofibrils, which can result in heart failure leading to death. Demyelination of peripheral nerves and neuropathy of the brain may occur. Mortality from this infection is high, estimated to be between 5 and 17%. Mortality is highest in children 3 to 6 years old <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib15">(15)</link>.</para>
        <para>Because this is a toxin-mediated disease, antimicrobial therapy is of secondary importance therapeutically, although eliminating the source of exotoxin production by antimicrobial therapy is important<link linkend="ch0041s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Rather, acute therapy with horse-derived DT antitoxin is essential <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib15">(15)</link>. There are three problems with this therapy. First, it does not reverse the activity of toxin that has already entered and damaged cells. By binding to the extracellular toxin, antitoxin can only prevent it from entering cells. Second, some individuals may experience anaphylactic reaction to horse proteins, so anyone receiving this product should have allergic skin testing done prior to therapy. Third, this antitoxin is not widely available and release of it for therapy is tightly controlled by public health agencies, making delays in therapy likely. Additionally, there are limited supplies globally, and it may not be available in regions of the world where this disease is most common.</para>
        <para>Control of <emphasis>C. diphtheriae</emphasis> infection has been accomplished in much of the world through vaccination using a diphtheroid toxoid (a chemically inactivated toxin) <link linkend="ch0041s0002bib15">(15)</link>. This toxoid is a component of a trivalent vaccine containing this toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis antigens. There are two trivalent vaccine forms, one with killed whole-cell <emphasis>Bordetella pertussis</emphasis> (used for decades; called DTP) and the other an acellular vaccine containing inactivated pertussis toxin and other pertussis antigens in addition to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (approved at the beginning of this century; called DTaP). These antigens elicit a highly protective immune response that prevents infections with these organisms. Three doses are given during the first 6 months of life with booster doses given throughout life, for adults once every 10 years. Some adults prefer to receive only the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT vaccine). These vaccines are highly effective in preventing diphtheria, with only one case reported in the United States in 2022. Vaccination vigilance in adults is necessary to prevent the reemergence of two diseases, tetanus and diphtheria. In places in the world where conflict is occurring such as Haiti, Yemen, and Somalia, making vaccination difficult, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria have occurred. In high-income countries, this disease may occur in individuals whose immunity has waned either because vaccination is not available due to inaccessible health care or because of vaccine refusal.</para>
