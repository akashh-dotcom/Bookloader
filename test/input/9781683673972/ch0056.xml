Ten days previously, the patient had returned from a holiday trip to visit his family in Guatemala. He was both in urban areas and at the Caribbean coast. He received many mosquito bites and did not take malaria prophylaxis. He had one episode of diarrhea during his visit, but that resolved within 1 day.</para>
      <para>One week prior to presentation, he began to develop malaise, headache, and fevers with some sweating and chills. Over the 3 days prior to presentation, he had fevers throughout the day to 39.0°C with drenching sweats. He also complained of intermittent headaches. He did not complain of stiff neck, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. His urine appeared somewhat darker than normal to him. He had normal oral intake.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The major agents of febrile illness in a traveler returning from Guatemala, especially one who visited rural areas, would be malaria, dengue fever, and typhoid fever, which is caused by <emphasis>Salmonella enterica</emphasis> serovar Typhi <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The patient’s failure to take malaria prophylaxis and multiple mosquito bites means that his physician should be aggressive in ruling out malaria because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. The early onset of fever soon after returning from an area in which malaria is endemic is more typical of <emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum</emphasis> than <emphasis>Plasmodium vivax</emphasis>, which tends to have a more extended incubation period. Paradoxically, almost all cases of malaria in returning travelers from Guatemala are due to <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis>, so it was unlikely that the patient had malaria. When malaria is suspected, peripheral blood thin and thick smears should be examined for the various stages of the <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> protozoan.</para>
        <para>A second infection that would need to be considered is dengue fever (also called “breakbone fever”). Dengue is caused by dengue virus, which is transmitted by <emphasis>Aedes</emphasis> species mosquitoes, which are endemic in Guatemala. The prevalence of this infection is much greater in Guatemala than either malaria or typhoid fever <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Individuals with dengue typically have a rash, headache, and significant joint, muscle, or bone pain. He did not report having a rash nor complain of myalgia or joint or bone pain, all hallmarks of this infection, making this diagnosis less likely.</para>
        <para>Typhoid fever is endemic in Guatemala, especially in rural areas, which may not have clean water supplies and/or adequate human waste sanitation. Guatemala is considered a country with a moderate risk for typhoid fever acquisition<link linkend="ch0056s0002bib03">(3)</link>. One of the key features of typhoid fever is high fever, usually 39°C or higher, and often no diarrhea. A similar febrile illness can be caused by a closely related <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovar, Paratyphi. Since they are clinically similar, they are frequently referred to as enteric fever <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib04">(4)</link>. <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Paratyphi causes less severe disease.</para>
        <para>Other pathogens that should be considered in travelers to Guatemala and to Central America in general include Zika virus (spread by mosquito bites), leptospirosis (contaminated water), Chagas’ disease (spread by reduviid bugs), and leishmaniasis (sand fly bites)<link linkend="ch0056s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  A standard approach for diagnosing malaria is to review blood smears for different stages of the protozoan parasite. <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> would be the species of malaria most likely to infect a traveler to Guatemala. Because <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> only infects reticulocytes, it rarely infects more than 2% of red blood cells and typically a much lower percentage. As a result, multiple thin blood smears should be examined to ensure that this species of the parasite is not missed. Because of the low level of parasitemia, thick smears may increase sensitivity of microscopic examination. At least 300 microscopic fields at a magnification of ×1,000 should be examined before the smear is considered negative <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib05">(5)</link>. After appropriate examination of several smears, all of which were negative, a malaria infection was ruled out in the patient.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>   There are two possible approaches to treating this patient. Because of concern for sepsis caused by a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rod, the first approach would be to use broad-spectrum antimicrobials <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Possible choices would include piperacillin-tazobactam or a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone. Both are given intravenously and thus would require admission to the hospital or, at the very least, a prolonged emergency room stay or one in a short-stay unit, since it would be ~24 hours until the organism’s identity is known.</para>
        <para>If the patient was judged to not require hospital admission, prior to discharge he could be given a loading dose of ceftriaxone, which should treat his infection until the organism’s identity was known. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results could then be used to modify antimicrobial therapy if necessary.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The organism that was present in his blood based on the phenotypic tests listed was <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovar Typhi, one of the two <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovars, <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovar Paratyphi being the other, that cause enteric fever <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib07">(7)</link>. <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi produces a unique reaction in a TSI tube where there is a small amount of H<subscript>2</subscript>S produced compared to other <emphasis>S. enterica</emphasis> serovars that blackens the entire bottom of the TSI tube. When it was known that the patient was infected with <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi, outpatient treatment with oral antimicrobials became a realistic option <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib07">(7)</link>. However, there are four possible choices proven to be effective against <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi depending upon the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolate. These include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, fluoroquinolones, and azithromycin. Oral cephalosporins and aminoglycosides are not effective against this organism <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Which drugs are most likely effective is based on where the individual acquired <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi. In this particular case, the patient became infected in Guatemala. Drug-resistant <emphasis>S.</emphasis> Typhi strains are unusual there, so any of the four drugs should be effective <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib08">(8)</link>. However, the first principle of antimicrobial stewardship is to use the effective drug that has the narrowest antimicrobial spectrum. Of these drugs, amoxicillin has the narrowest spectrum and would therefore be the most appropriate drug. However, most of the <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi cases that occur in the industrialized world are imported from Asia, particularly the Indian subcontinent <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib07">(7)</link>. <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi strains resistant to the first-line therapies for typhoid fever, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol, emerged in the 1990s. Genes for this resistance are encoded on the <emphasis>inc</emphasis>HI1 plasmid <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Strains carrying this plasmid are widely distributed throughout Asia, particularly South Asia. As a result, fluoroquinolones became the drug of choice to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi infections. Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) initially resulted in low-level resistance to these drugs, but multiple mutations eventually resulted in high-level resistance, first in Southeast Asia and migrating over time to the Indian subcontinent <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib09">(9)</link>. In addition to fluoroquinolone resistance, MDR <emphasis>S.</emphasis> Typhi strains resistant to ceftriaxone have emerged in Pakistan. As a result, azithromycin has become the drug of choice for treatment of these extremely drug-resistant (XDR) <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi strains. Unfortunately, azithromycin resistance due to mutation in efflux pumps in XDR isolates has been reported <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Paradoxically, in regions where resistance to fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, and now azithromycin is becoming commonplace, so has the emergence of strains susceptible to the first-line drugs ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib09">(9)</link>. This reversion to susceptibility may be due to a reduction in antimicrobial pressure to these three agents. Empiric therapy for typhoid fever initially should be based on the geographic area where the individual was infected and then on the antimicrobial susceptibility test results of the isolate.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi only infects humans and higher primates. This is because <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi adhesins, which allow the organism to cause infections, are specific for human cells <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib10">(10)</link>. It is transmitted from human to human primarily by ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water. As the historical case of Typhoid Mary taught us, <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi excreters who fail to wash their hands after defecating and then prepare food are potential sources of this organism. That is why many restaurants have signs in restrooms reminding employees to wash their hands before returning to work.</para>
        <para>The other common source is the ingestion of water, sometimes in the form of ice, drawn from sources that have been contaminated by feces from individuals excreting the organism. The use of water contaminated with human waste to irrigate vegetables, particularly leafy ones such as lettuce, which is eaten raw, is why the CDC recommends avoiding eating raw vegetables in areas where <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi is endemic <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Almost all cases of <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi in the United States are obtained either during travel abroad or from individuals who recently immigrated. The vast majority of those cases come from Asia and Africa, where there is inadequate safe water supplies, poor disposal of human waste (sanitation), or poor personal hygiene. Excellent sanitation has essentially eliminated endemic cases of <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi in the United States.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  A high inoculum (10<superscript>6</superscript> CFU/ml) is needed because of this organism’s susceptibility to stomach acid. The organisms that survive transit through the stomach multiply in the terminal ileum <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib10">(10)</link>. The organism is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule called Vi that allows it to evade phagocytosis by neutrophils. The organism uses fimbriae to attach to the intestinal epithelium. Using a type III secretion system, the organism injects proteins into M cells, specialized epithelial cells that play a role in gut mucosal immunity <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Normally, antigens from the gut lumen are taken up by these cells and then processed by antigen-presenting cells in the Peyer’s patches. The organism has a series of genes encoding proteins involved in the invasion of epithelial and epithelial-like cells. This series of genes is located in a region of the bacterial chromosome called a pathogenicity island. The typhoid bacilli subvert the function of the M cells to invade the Peyer’s patches. Within the Peyer’s patches, they are phagocytized by macrophages but survive and multiply within “<emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis>-containing vacuoles” that are produced in response to <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi-encoded proteins <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib12">(12)</link>. From the Peyer’s patches they can be carried by macrophages to the bloodstream via the lymphatics. The organisms are released from macrophages following apoptosis. The process of phagocytosis, intracellular survival, and multiplication can be repeated in macrophages, with dissemination of the organism to the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. In the liver, the organism enters bile, is excreted into the intestines, and is eventually passed to the environment in feces.</para>
        <para>Typhoid fever is characterized by high fevers, typically 39°C or above, lasting for 2 to 4 weeks<link linkend="ch0056s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Severe manifestations of disease include intestinal hemorrhage, intestinal perforation with peritonitis, and encephalitis. Mortality in the antimicrobial era in the industrialized world is less than 1%.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Approximately 2 to 5% of patients with typhoid fever will become chronic carriers of <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Chronic carriers are asymptomatic but may excrete large numbers (&gt;10<superscript>6</superscript> CFU/ml) of <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi organisms in their feces into the environment. This process can continue for many years.</para>
        <para>Our current understanding of the carriage state is that there are two potential mechanisms<link linkend="ch0056s0002bib10">(10)</link>. One is that <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi organisms are carried in bile from the liver to the gallbladder. Bile upregulates genes involved in the invasion of the organism into gallbladder epithelial cells when they replicate intracellularly. The infected cells burst and organisms are secreted in the intestinal tract in bile <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib12">(12)</link>.</para>
        <para>In the second mechanism, the organism grows as a biofilm on cholesterol-containing gallstones<link linkend="ch0056s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Planktonic cells detach from the biofilm and are carried in bile to the intestinal tract and are excreted in feces. Because 90% of chronic carriers have gallstones, this mechanism of chronic carriage is more certain.</para>
        <para>There is no evidence that antimicrobial therapy is effective in eliminating the chronic carriage of <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Why is this? First, not all antimicrobials are excreted in bile, so only antimicrobials with that mode of excretion could be used. Second, it is extremely difficult to eradicate organisms growing either intracellularly or as biofilms. The only method proven to be effective in eliminating carriage is to remove the gallbladder from <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi carriers <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib12">(12)</link>.</para>
        <para>To illustrate the chronic carrier state, we saw an 80-year-old patient who had his gallbladder removed. He gave his surgeon a history of having had typhoid fever when he was 20 years old but had been in excellent health since then. The surgeon sent a swab of the patient’s gallbladder for culture, and it grew <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi, 60 years after his original infection!</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Because of the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance in <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi, infection prevention has become of even greater importance. This is particularly true for travelers to the Indian subcontinent, where rates of multidrug-resistant <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi are high and XDR strains are emerging. The simplest way to avoid contracting <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi is to avoid consuming fecally contaminated food and water. However, this is simply not practical in many parts of the world where inadequate clean water, sanitary infrastructure, and hygiene (WASH) are the norm. This results in high levels of fecal contamination of food and water. Travelers to areas with poor WASH infrastructure should consider vaccination against <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi. This seems to be particularly true for individuals, such as the patient in this case, who visit friends or relatives in middle- and low-income countries <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Although they represent a small fraction of individuals who travel from high-income countries to low- and middle-income countries, it is estimated that 80% of typhoid fever cases occur in travelers who visit friends or relatives. It is thought that these individuals have less control over the food and water that they consume, and because many originally lived in the countries that they visit, they may be more willing to eat food from street vendors, a well-recognized source of enteric infections in travelers.</para>
        <para>Two vaccines are currently approved in the United States; they are protective and recommended for use<link linkend="ch0056s0002bib13">(13)</link>. One is derived from the Vi capsular polysaccharide antigen found on the surface of the typhoid bacillus. A single injection of this vaccine is given, with boosters recommended every 2 years. Vaccine efficacy is 55% at 3 years. Because children &lt;2 years of age do not make a reliable immune response to polysaccharide vaccines, this vaccine is not recommended for this age group <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>
        <para>The other is a live, attenuated oral vaccine. It is given as four capsules orally over a 1-week period. It elicits primarily a cell-mediated response, and immunity with this vaccine lasts for ~7 years. The estimated vaccine efficacy at 3 years is 51%<link linkend="ch0056s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Booster doses after the initial series of four oral doses are currently recommended after 5 years. Currently this vaccine is not recommended for children &lt;5 years of age, individuals living with HIV, or individuals with other immunocompromising conditions such as those receiving steroids, radiation, or chemotherapy. Because this is a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine, it should not be administered to individuals receiving antimicrobials until at least 24 hours after the completion of this therapy.</para>
        <para>A disadvantage of both these vaccines is they must be kept refrigerated, which may be problematic for vaccine campaigns in tropical areas.</para>
        <para>In areas of <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi endemicity, addressing the huge infrastructure costs needed to eliminate its transmission is currently not feasible <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Vaccines, then, are the only current alternative to prevent this disease, which is estimated to cause 10 million to 20 million cases a year and between 100,000 and 150,000 deaths, primarily in young children <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib03">(3)</link>. The vaccines available in the industrialized world are problematic because they require an expensive cold chain and are not effective or cannot be used in the most vulnerable population, those under 2 years of age. A conjugate vaccine containing tetanus toxoid and Vi capsular polysaccharide has been prequalified for use by the World Health Organization <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib16">(16)</link>. The efficacy of this vaccine is not yet clear, but it appears to be safe and elicits an antibody response against Vi capsular antigen, including in children 6 months to 2 years of age <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib17">(17)</link>. Like the approved vaccines in the United States, it requires a cold chain of 2 to 8°C.</para>
        <para>An important potential benefit of an effective vaccine would be the reduction of inappropriate antimicrobial use in areas where typhoid fever is endemic. Currently it is estimated that for every case of culture-confirmed enteric fever (due to either <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Typhi or <emphasis>S</emphasis>. Paratyphi), between 3 and 25 additional people with fever are treated with antimicrobials <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Reducing the use of inappropriate antimicrobials by lowering the number of cases of enteric fever and the perceived need for antimicrobials may contribute to lowering antimicrobial pressure and thus resistance.</para>
        <para>The next step is to develop a vaccine for the other cause of enteric fever,<emphasis>S</emphasis>. Paratyphi, since none of the available typhoid vaccines are protective against this serovar <link linkend="ch0056s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
