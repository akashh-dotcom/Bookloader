      <sect1 id="ch0048s0004"><title>CASE 45</title><para>A 10-year-old female presented in August to the emergency department of a North Carolina hospital with a 3-day history of worsening headache and petechial rash. She began feeling ill approximately 1 week before presentation, with increasing fatigue, intermittent chills, and lower back pain. She had 1 day of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with a yellowish nasal discharge. Her headache, which began 3 days previously, was exacerbated by light and rapid movement. Over-the-counter medications did not affect her headache. The patient stated that her “head hurts everywhere,” and her neck felt stiff. In addition to the headache and general malaise, she had a small pinpoint rash over her legs, trunk, and upper extremities. The only known sick contacts were two younger cousins with fever and rash. She had a history of a tick bite earlier in the summer.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Determining the cause of a fever or headache in children can be challenging and should be first differentiated by whether the patient has localized symptoms in addition to fever or headache <link linkend="ch0048s0002bib01">(1)</link>. In this case, the patient presented with a petechial rash, fatigue, body aches, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and nasal discharge. Petechial rashes in children warrant immediate evaluation and life-threatening illnesses such as meningococcemia should be ruled out as soon as possible <link linkend="ch0048s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Causes of a petechial rash in children include meningococcemia (disseminated infection with <emphasis>Neisseria meningiditis</emphasis>), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (caused by <emphasis>Rickettsia ricketsii</emphasis>), and viral infections caused by coxsackievirus A9, echovirus 9, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, arboviruses, and arenaviruses. The headache and neck stiffness that the patient presented with suggest meningitis, and this should be investigated further. The most common cause of pediatric viral meningitis, particularly during the summer and fall months, is enterovirus <link linkend="ch0048s0002bib03">(3)</link>. However, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and arboviruses cannot be excluded without additional laboratory testing. <emphasis>N. meningiditis</emphasis> is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 <link linkend="ch0048s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Finally, given that the patient presented with a headache and rash in North Carolina during the summer, Rocky Mountain spotted fever must also be in the differential.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The finding of &gt;3 white blood cells per μl in the CSF suggests that meningitis is likely. Brudzinski’s and Kernig’s signs, if positive, indicate meningeal irritation. These signs have a diagnostic sensitivity as low as 5%, but meningitis-specific specificity is high. Therefore, the fact that these signs were negative in this patient does not rule out meningitis. The patient reported that her neck was stiff, which was also appreciated on the physical exam. The normal protein and glucose levels measured in her CSF indicate that this was unlikely to be bacterial meningitis but could still be mycobacterial, fungal, or viral meningitis. The CSF cell count showed approximately equal numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Although viral meningitis is typically associated with a lymphocytic predominance in the CSF, there is often a neutrophilic predominance in the first 48 hours of the disease. Because fungal and mycobacterial meningitis in children is rare in the United States, the most likely source of her meningitis is viral.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Due to the potential severity of bacterial meningitis in children, empiric therapy should be started as soon as possible if meningitis is suspected. Antibiotic choice and dosing will depend on the patient’s age and most likely infectious agent. Since this patient falls in the age group where infection with <emphasis>N. meningiditis</emphasis> is most likely, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is recommended <link linkend="ch0048s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Doxycycline is the recommended empiric therapy when Rocky Mountain spotted fever is suspected (see <ulink url="ch0043.xml#ch0043">case 40</ulink>), and it was administered to this patient due to her history of a tick bite and clinical presentation <link linkend="ch0048s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>Enteroviruses include the coxsackieviruses (A and B), echoviruses, polioviruses, and the numbered enteroviruses (e. g., enterovirus 71). Parechoviruses (formerly echoviruses 22 and 23) have been shown to be genetically distinct from the enteroviruses, and are also a common cause of viral meningitis in children. Although parechoviruses are an important cause of pediatric meningitis (particularly for children less than 3 months, in whom disease can be most severe and testing is indicated), it is important to note that most enteroviral NAATs will not detect them. Enteroviruses belong to the family <emphasis>Picornaviridae</emphasis>, along with rhinovirus and hepatitis A virus. The primary mode of enteroviral transmission is the fecal-oral route, but it can also spread via the respiratory route and by fomites. Approximately 85% of viral meningitis cases in the United States are due to enteroviruses, although very few enteroviral infections result in meningitis. In fact, most enteroviral infections are subclinical to mild. Like other childhood exanthems, enteroviral infections in children may present with only fever and rash, as was presumably the case for this patient’s cousins. Enteroviral infections typically peak in the spring to fall months in temperate regions.</para>
        <para>The nonpolio enteroviruses are ubiquitous and cause a wide range of diseases. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is characterized by fever, mouth blisters/ulcers, and rash (often on the hands and feet) and is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A serotype 16 (A16). From 2011 to 2012, there was a large outbreak of HFMD in the United States caused by coxsackievirus A6<link linkend="ch0048s0002bib07">(7)</link>. This outbreak was widespread and included more severe manifestations of HFMD, including some hospitalizations. Coxsackievirus A and enterovirus 70 have caused outbreaks of conjunctivitis. Coxsackievirus B is the most common cause of viral meningitis in children &lt;3 months of age (~60%). Typically, the mother has a subclinical or mild enteroviral illness that is passed to the infant shortly after birth. In these young infants, enteroviral infection can be particularly severe, including meningitis and pericarditis. Enteroviruses 70 and 71 are particularly neurotropic enteroviruses and often cause more severe disease, including meningoencephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Enterovirus 71 has caused HFMD outbreaks worldwide, including cases of brain stem encephalitis. Echoviruses comprise most of the remaining enteroviral meningitis cases, including several viral meningitis outbreaks in the United States.</para>
        <para>In 2014, enterovirus D68 caused a nationwide outbreak of respiratory illness. At the same time, an increasing number of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) cases were reported in children<link linkend="ch0048s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Surveillance tactics and investigational clinical research since the 2014 outbreak have demonstrated a possible causal relationship between enterovirus D68 and AFM in children. There is no routine test to specifically detect enterovirus D68, and the diagnosis remains primarily clinical <link linkend="ch0048s0002bib09">(9)</link>. While standard respiratory tests may detect enterovirus, they do not differentiate between enterovirus and rhinovirus (i. e., a positive result with either rhinovirus or enterovirus would be reported as positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus). In cases of severe, unexplained respiratory illness, additional molecular testing may be performed at public health laboratories or the CDC.</para>
        <para>The polioviruses are unique among the enteroviruses in that they can cause severe paralysis, including permanent disability and death, and in the fact that infections due to polioviruses are vaccine preventable. During the 1940s and 1950s, there were approximately 35,000 cases of poliomyelitis annually in the United States. However, after the development of two vaccines in the 1950s, poliovirus was eradicated from the United States in 1979. Active poliovirus transmission still occurs in other areas of the world. As with other enteroviruses, most individuals infected with polioviruses are asymptomatic. Fewer than 1% of those infected become paralyzed, and of these, 5 to 10% die due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Because enteroviruses are spread primarily by the fecal-oral route, good handwashing techniques aid in preventing the spread of infection. Frequent handwashing and surface disinfection help interrupt the transmission cycle, particularly in day care or school settings, where enteroviral infections often spread. Further, since enteroviruses can also spread by the respiratory route and by fomites (in particular, HFMD), it is recommended to avoid all close contact, including kissing, hugging, and sharing eating utensils and cups. There is no vaccine available for the non-poliovirus enteroviruses. To prevent poliovirus infections in the United States, vaccination with an enhanced form of the inactivated polio vaccine is currently recommended at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. The vaccine contains all three poliovirus serotypes. The live, attenuated oral polio vaccine is no longer recommended in the United States due to the rare complication of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (1 in 2.4 million doses, or 5 to 10 cases annually). Since 1979, the only indigenous cases of polio reported in the United States have been associated with the live oral vaccine. Previously, the oral vaccine was preferred because it conferred both humoral and mucosal immunity, and the live, attenuated nature of the vaccine provided herd immunity by fecal-oral spread to unvaccinated contacts. The oral poliovirus vaccine is very effective (&gt;95%) and continues to be used worldwide.</para>
        <para>There is no enterovirus-specific treatment, and most patients fully recover from their infections without intervention. Treatment of enteroviral infections is supportive. For example, hydration and pain relief for mouth sores might be indicated for those with HFMD. Patients with enteroviral meningitis occasionally require hospitalization to provide the appropriate level of supportive care. However, most patients are initially admitted to determine the diagnosis, some of which (i. e., bacterial meningitis, HSV meningitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever) have specific therapeutic interventions and higher morbidity and mortality. The use of NAATs to provide a rapid, accurate laboratory diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis has been shown to result in hospital cost savings by reducing the length of hospitalization and unnecessary antimicrobial use in both pediatric and adult patients.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>Two poliovirus vaccines became available in the mid-20th century: the Salk inactivated vaccine in 1955 and the Sabin live, attenuated oral vaccine in 1962. The two vaccines successfully eradicated poliovirus transmission in most industrialized countries, with the last indigenous U. S. case seen in 1979. The strategy to make the world polio-free is increasing worldwide vaccination coverage, particularly in children, and enhancing surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases. Once there are no (or very few) humans susceptible to poliovirus infection, fecal shedding of polioviruses into the environment will cease and the transmission cycle will be interrupted. Global vaccination efforts have resulted in a decrease in worldwide wild poliomyelitis incidence from 350,000 cases in more than 125 countries to only 12 cases reported worldwide in 2023. Poliovirus type 2 was declared eradicated worldwide in 1999 and type 3 in 2019, but type 1 is still detected in clinical disease and environmental surveillance. Polioviruses have remained endemic<link linkend="ch0048s0002bib10">(10)</link> in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</para>
        <para>In 2022, an unvaccinated individual from Rockland County, New York, developed acute flaccid paralysis related to type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus<link linkend="ch0048s0002bib11">(11)</link>. This led the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO) to release a statement calling for improved vigilance of immunization rates. Prior to 2019, polio vaccination rates had been dropping. However, this problem was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, only 80% of children had received the third dose of polio vaccine, a decrease of 87% compared to 2019. Polio vaccination coverage is recommended to be at 95% or greater to prevent the reintroduction of the virus into a given region. WHO and PAHO continue to encourage the use of sensitive surveillance systems with trained health professionals who can identify and notify health authorities about suspected acute flaccid paralysis. A country’s surveillance system should be sensitive enough to detect at least 1 case of acute flaccid paralysis for every 100,000 children under the age of 15. Since acute flaccid paralysis caused by polio may be difficult to differentiate from other causes, all children with acute flaccid paralysis should be screened for wild poliovirus within 14 days of paralysis onset. Fecal samples should be collected and frozen, and should arrive at the laboratory within 72 hours of collection for confirmatory testing.</para>
        <para>As the goal of worldwide eradication of polioviruses approaches, it will be important to define what strains, if any, should be stored in laboratories<link linkend="ch0048s0002bib12">(12)</link>. This has been a contentious issue for the smallpox virus, a potential agent of bioterrorism and biowarfare. Other issues include the cessation of routine oral poliovirus vaccination. This WHO recommendation is based on the concern for circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, the attenuated vaccine virus that accumulates genetic changes that render it virulent and, therefore, a source of outbreaks. To discontinue the oral vaccine, the inactivated vaccine must become less expensive and broadly available in low- and middle-income countries. Lastly, continued vigilance in the surveillance program for acute flaccid paralysis will be necessary until complete eradication is confirmed. Funding for the surveillance program in the posteradication era is a concern.</para>
