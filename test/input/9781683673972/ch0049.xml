        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Rapid progression of a headache to severe alteration in mental status with compensatory hypertension is consistent with an acute intracranial process caused by either a stroke or infection.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Both the CSF cell count and protein were within normal limits for the institution where he received care. Although the CSF protein was slightly elevated, it would not be considered abnormal by most clinicians based on the other normal CSF findings.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  CSF is normally sterile, so organisms should never be present there. The large, round structures that are predominantly Gram positive are yeast cells surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule. The round morphology with narrow based budding is most consistent with the yeast <emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis>, the primary agent of fungal meningitis. <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> can be of varying sizes but is significantly larger than bacteria. Another species of <emphasis>Cryptococcus, C. gatti</emphasis> is now recognized as an infrequent cause of fungal meningitis primarily in areas with warm wet climates associated with eucalyptus trees. In the United States and Canada, cases have been seen primarily in the Pacific Northwest or in those who have recently traveled there. Unlike <emphasis>C. neoformans,</emphasis> it can cause meningitis in immunocompetent individuals <link linkend="ch0049s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  The reddish rim around the yeast cell is consistent with a capsule. The capsule that surrounds the cell and protects it from phagocytosis is composed of a polysaccharide (glucuronoxylomannan) specific to <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis>. It can be detected using antibody specific for it in a lateral flow antigen (<emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> capsular polysaccharide) detection test <link linkend="ch0049s0002bib04">(4)</link>. This test takes 10 minutes to perform and is highly sensitive (99%) and specific (98%). It has replaced India ink microscopic examination of CSF as a rapid means to identify cryptococci. India ink is a negative stain, meaning the background is stained but not the organism. The organism is surrounded by a clear halo, which is due to the capsular polysaccharide not taking up the stain. It has a sensitivity of only 86% and requires expert microscopic skills since white blood cells can be confused with cryptococci because of similarities in size and morphology.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  A young adult male who has evidence of cryptococcal meningitis has a high likelihood of having advanced HIV disease <link linkend="ch0049s0002bib05">(5)</link>. One of the features of advanced HIV disease is a poor or absent cell-mediated immune response. Cell-mediated immunity is essential for protection against fungal pathogens. Because an individual with a low CD4 count (see <phrase>answer to question 10</phrase> for more details) cannot mount a cell-mediated response to this organism, the white cell count and protein may appear “normal.” In patients with a functioning immune system, we would expect to see an elevated white blood cell count in the CSF (usually in the range of 100 to 500 cells/μl with a predominance of lymphocytes) and elevated protein due in part to the immune response to the organisms.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>The CDC recommends a fourth-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that detects antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and p 24 antigen<link linkend="ch0049s0002bib06">(6)</link>. If the initial EIA test is positive, a confirmatory test is done for HIV-1 and -2 antibodies. If these are both negative, an HIV viral load assay is done to confirm the p 24 antigen part of the assay (see<ulink url="ch0065.xml#ch0065">case 62</ulink> for further discussion).</para>

A Gram stain of the colony could be used to confirm that the organism is a round encapsulated yeast with narrow based budding. Further testing, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) could be done to confirm the identity of the organism as <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis>. It is important to note that <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> is intrinsically resistant to echinocandin antifungals, like micafungin, which are widely used to treat most yeast infections. It is therefore critical that clinicians be rapidly alerted to this diagnosis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">12.</emphasis>  <emphasis>C. neoformans</emphasis> is ubiquitous in nature, widely distributed in soil<emphasis> </emphasis><link linkend="ch0049s0002bib07">(7)</link>. It is frequently found in areas with high concentrations of birds because bird guano contains nutrients that enhance its growth. Individuals become infected by breathing in dehydrated yeast cells or spores from the environment. Its capsule allows it to initially evade phagocytosis, but T-cell-mediated granuloma formation, where the cryptococcal cells are walled off in the lung tissue, limits disease progression. Infected immunocompetent patients rarely have symptoms, and when they do, they are mild and do not require medical care. In individuals with advanced HIV disease, the reduction or absence of cell-mediated immunity allows the encapsulated yeasts to multiply and penetrate into the bloodstream from the lung, causing fungemia. In individuals with very low CD4 cell counts, as was seen in this patient, this organism may then cross the blood-brain barrier and cause meningitis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">13.</emphasis>  A potential complication of antiretroviral therapy in patients with advanced HIV disease who develop cryptococcal meningitis is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, or IRIS <link linkend="ch0049s0002bib09">(9)</link>. In IRIS, as the CD4 count increases during antiretroviral therapy, the patient can mount an inflammatory response to, in this case, cryptococcal antigens. This inflammation can cause brain edema. In severe episodes of IRIS, this edema can result in brain herniation and death. Naïve patients with advanced HIV disease (those who have not received antiretroviral therapy) and cryptococcal meningitis should first be treated for their fungal infection to reduce organism burden and subsequently treated for HIV. When naïve HIV-infected patients were treated concordantly with antifungal and antiretroviral therapies, they had a 15% higher mortality <link linkend="ch0049s0002bib09">(9)</link>. The timing of when to institute antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients being treated for cryptococcal meningitis is multifactorial and beyond the scope of this discussion.</para>

            <para>In individuals who have cryptococcal meningitis as an advanced HIV disease-defining condition, initiation of antiretroviral therapy is delayed because of concerns for IRIS. As the immune system “recovers” during antiretroviral therapy, individuals may develop a severe inflammatory response to cryptococcal antigens in the central nervous system, which may lead to brain edema and, in its most severe manifestations, herniation and death. The initiation of antiretroviral therapy following resolution of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with advanced HIV disease is complex.</para>
