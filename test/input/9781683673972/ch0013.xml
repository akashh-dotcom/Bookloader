        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The patient’s syndrome is referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI). Although several respiratory viruses cause ILI, influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the most common causes of febrile respiratory illness in adults. In pediatric patients (particularly those &lt;1 year old), respiratory syncytial virus should also be considered (see <ulink url="ch0014.xml#ch0014">case 11</ulink>). The clinical clues of his ILI are the abrupt onset of fever and sore throat with nonproductive cough. It is difficult to clinically distinguish infections due to influenza A or B and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the patient should receive a rapid test for influenza and COVID-19 while he is in the ED.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  There are a variety of ways of detecting influenza virus in the laboratory, including rapid antigen tests, direct fluorescent-antibody assay, viral culture, and molecular detection. However, the main methods used today are rapid antigen and molecular tests. Rapid antigen tests are immunochromatographic assays that have been used for decades and have been favored due to their fast time to result (~15 minutes). However, as diagnostic methods have improved and circulating strains have changed, studies have shown that these tests suffer from lack of sensitivity. Sensitivities as low as 10% were reported during the 2009 influenza pandemic <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Typical ranges of rapid antigen sensitivity reported are 20 to 90%, depending on the strain circulating and the method used as the reference method. A further concern is the positive predictive value (PPV) of rapid antigen tests when used outside of peak influenza season. Since PPV is dependent on the prevalence of disease, using tests with imperfect specificities (90 to 95%) during times of low prevalence increases the chance that a positive result may be a false positive rather than a true positive. However, the times when laboratory testing for influenza is the most helpful clinically are at the beginning and end of the epidemic season, when the differential diagnosis is much broader. If rapid antigen tests must be used, alternative methods (i. e., molecular) should be available to confirm the results, as needed. The COVID-19 pandemic altered traditional “respiratory season,” which also complicated the estimation of PPV.</para>
        <para>The increase in molecular testing for influenza has been largely due to the low sensitivity observed with rapid antigen tests and the unpredictability of “flu season” that came during the COVID-19 pandemic (<link linkend="ch0013s0001fg01">Fig. 10.1</link>). Several FDA-cleared assays exist for the molecular detection of influenza with turnaround times ranging from 20 minutes to 8 hours. Sensitivities of these tests are 90 to 99%, with specificities of 98 to 99% <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Some of the tests can also type influenza (i. e., H1, H3, or 2009 H1N1), and some can detect other respiratory viruses and bacteria simultaneously such as the respiratory pathogen panel used for this patient. However, most of these tests are expensive, and insurers may not reimburse laboratories for the cost of large multiplex panels. Since influenza genomic sequences change rapidly, it is important to monitor the accuracy of molecular tests on an annual basis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Influenza virus has two major envelope proteins that contribute to its pathogenesis: neuraminidase and hemagglutinin <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Neuraminidase has at least two functions. Its major function seems to be the cleavage of sialic acid from the cell surface and progeny virions, which facilitates the spread of new virions from infected respiratory cells. There is also evidence supporting the role of neuraminidase in viral entry to the cell. One mechanism that has been proposed is that neuraminidase cleaves decoy receptors on mucins, cilia, and cellular glycocalyx so that the virus can have greater access to the functional receptors on the cell membrane. Once the virus penetrates to the cell surface, binding to specific sialic acid-rich receptors is mediated by hemagglutinin. Proteolytic cleavage of hemagglutinin by lung serine proteases is required for hemagglutinin activity. After the virus is endocytosed into the cell, hemagglutinin plays a role in the formation of channels through which viral RNA can enter the cytoplasm and initiate the viral replicative cycle.</para>

        <para>In recent years, only two hemagglutinin types (H1 and H3) and two neuraminidase types (N1 and N2) of influenza A virus have been widely circulating in humans (H1N1 and H3N2). However, due to antigenic variation, there are annual influenza epidemics and, in 2009, a pandemic.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  There are two major evolutionary concepts related to influenza virus—antigenic drift and antigenic shift <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib04">(4)</link>. A unique property of influenza viruses is that they have single-stranded RNA genomes made of eight segments. Each influenza gene is found on a separate viral RNA segment. Since the mutation rate for RNA is higher than that of DNA (10<superscript>–3</superscript> to 10<superscript>–5</superscript> versus 10<superscript>–6</superscript> to 10<superscript>–8</superscript> per base per generation), point mutations readily accumulate in influenza viruses. Although mutations occur throughout the influenza genome, mutations (and corresponding amino acid changes) in surface antigens, such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, have the greatest impact. For influenza A virus, these changes will not necessarily result in the change of the classification of a viral strain (which is based on the subtypes of the H and N antigens), but may lead to unique surface epitopes that are more likely to cause infections in previously infected or vaccinated persons. This is the basis for the decision to reevaluate and potentially change the formulation of the influenza vaccine annually to include recent strains, so that protective antibodies to the most recent strains will be made in response to the vaccine. Both influenza A and influenza B are constantly changing by antigenic drift.</para>
        <para>The more dramatic, and less common antigenic shift is due to genetic reassortment of genes to form a novel human influenza virus, which typically has different hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase proteins. Antigenic shift occurs during coinfection of a cell with two different influenza A viruses. Since the packaging of viral RNA segments occurs randomly, a coinfected cell could form a variety of different virions. The result could be a virus with a different classification (e. g., a shift from H1N1 to H5N1) or a virus of the same type but with divergent genomic sequences from nonhuman sources such as pigs or birds. The result is a new virus that differs dramatically from parent strains. The influenza A H1N1 pandemic of 2009 was a result of antigenic shift<link linkend="ch0013s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Although an H1N1 influenza virus had circulated globally for years, a reassortant H1N1 virus was introduced and spread worldwide. The 2009 H1N1 virus was a result of the introduction of Eurasian swine segments (neuraminidase and matrix) into the classical swine influenza strain that previously had only caused swine-to-swine transmission and rare swine-to-human transmission. When an antigenic shift occurs, most of the world’s population has little or no protection against the new virus, resulting in large epidemics or pandemics.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Most cases of influenza in this age group are self-limited and do not require hospitalization. Influenza is a much greater threat to individuals &gt;65 years of age and children &lt;5 years old. During most epidemics, the highest numbers of hospitalizations and deaths are in these age groups. Other individuals at risk for complications of influenza infection are those with underlying chronic pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; immunocompromised individuals; pregnant women, particularly in the second and third trimesters; and those with a variety of other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Interestingly, the patient’s AUD may have increased his risk for complications due to alcohol’s impact on number and function of CD8 T cells <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib06">(6)</link>. In 2009, obesity was shown to be an independent risk factor for increased mortality due to H1N1. During the pandemic, there was still significant disease and mortality in pediatric patients, with more than double the number of pediatric patients dying than in the previous three influenza seasons. Interestingly, the death rate for those 25 to 49 years of age was greatly increased as well, but little disease was seen in those &gt;55 years of age. This suggests that influenza strains circulating prior to 1955 provided some protection against the pandemic strain, which was confirmed by serologic surveillance studies.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The most common complication leading to increased morbidity and mortality is pneumonia <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib07">(7)</link>. This could be primary influenza virus pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, or a combination of the two. Most reported influenza-associated deaths appear to be due to influenza with accompanying bacterial pneumonia, especially pneumonia caused by <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> or <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>. To diagnose viral and/or bacterial pneumonia, a lower respiratory specimen (preferably bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] fluid) obtained prior to antibiotic administration is needed to culture for bacteria and test for influenza.</para>
        <para>The sputum obtained from this patient was rejected as inadequate for culture because there were no neutrophils present, suggesting a poor specimen collection. The patient’s BAL fluid was positive for influenza by a molecular test. The bacterial culture was uninformative, but the patient was on antibiotics at the time of collection due to the positive blood culture. The patient’s blood culture was positive for <emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis> (group A <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis>). Therefore, he likely had both influenza and group A <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> pneumonia, leading to his complicated clinical course that he fortunately survived.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  There are inactivated culture-based vaccines (egg-based and cell culture-based) and a recombinant vaccine. There is also a high-dose inactivated vaccine for individuals ≥65 years old and a live attenuated nasal mist vaccine for people 2 to 49 years old. The live attenuated vaccine should not be given to pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, or those caring for immunocompromised individuals.</para>
        <para>For the 2023-2024 season, the vaccine strains included two subtypes of influenza A, 2009 H1N1 and H3N2, and two lineages of influenza B<link linkend="ch0013s0002bib08">(8)</link>. The disappearance of influenza B/Yamagata lineage during the COVID-19 pandemic led to future vaccines only including one strain of influenza B (Victoria lineage). It is important to remember that the composition of the vaccine changes annually. This is determined by the types of viruses that circulated during the previous season in the Southern Hemisphere. Due to waning immunity and antigenic drift of the viruses, the vaccine must be given annually. The efficacy of the vaccine is dependent on the level of change that may occur from year to year in the circulating virus, but it is generally 60 to 70% effective.</para>
        <para>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone ≥6 months of age get an influenza vaccine<link linkend="ch0013s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Vaccination is especially important for at-risk persons (see the <phrase>answer to question 5</phrase> for a listing of at-risk populations). This includes children aged 6 months to 4 years, people 50 years and older, and health care personnel who could transmit the virus to at-risk patients. The vaccine is not recommended for children &lt;6 months of age, a population that would most likely benefit from influenza virus vaccination. Numerous studies have proven the efficacy of this vaccine strategy. Recent studies also show that immunocompetent children benefit from vaccination through reduction in hospitalizations, doctor office visits, antibiotic use, serious secondary bacterial infections, and spread to at-risk family members. Unfortunately, the influenza vaccination rate in the United States is ~50% and is decreasing <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  There are four antiviral drugs currently available for the treatment of influenza—oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir marboxil (<link linkend="ch0013s0001ta01">Table 10.1</link>) <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir are neuraminidase inhibitors. These agents are most effective if given in the first 2 days of illness and reduce the disease course by 1 day. However, data suggest that giving neuraminidase inhibitors at any time to a seriously ill patient may have benefits. Neuraminidase inhibitors are active against both influenza A and B viruses. However, influenza A H1 (pre-pandemic strain) is resistant to oseltamivir, and sporadic cases of H3 and 2009 H1N1 resistance have been described. To date, the majority of circulating influenza strains maintain susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors. A new antiviral class became available in 2018. Baloxavir marboxil targets the viral polymerase and inhibits influenza replication, which means it may effectively treat neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant strains <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Another advantage of baloxavir is that it is a single dose. Cases of baloxavir resistance have been described, particularly in patients on therapy <link linkend="ch0013s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Continued surveillance for antiviral resistance is important to determine the public health impact.</para>
