        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetically inherited disease in populations of Northern European descent, affecting more than 30,000 individuals in the United States <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Other countries with large CF populations include Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, northern members of the European Union, Brazil, and Australia. For a child to be born with CF disease, they must inherit one mutated CF gene from each parent <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Common CF manifestations include chronic lung infections, which are the leading cause of premature death in this population; pancreatic insufficiency leading to malnutrition and failure to thrive if undiagnosed in infancy; diabetes later in life; metabolic bone disease in adults; and male infertility <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The current median life expectancy of a child born with CF is almost 50 years <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  CFTR is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>. It is a chloride (Cl<superscript>–</superscript>) ion channel found in cells throughout the body. In the respiratory tract, the secretion of Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions attracts water to the surface of bronchial epithelial cells, hydrating mucus. Hydrated mucus is essential in normal ciliary clearance of inhaled particles from the bronchi, including microbes. PwCF have specific mutations in the gene encoding CFTR. Mutations in CFTR lead to cells that are not able to secrete Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions. This results in dehydration of mucus overlaying ciliated epithelial cells. This dehydration causes the mucus layer to become thick and sticky, inhibiting normal ciliary clearance and leading to chronic bacterial infections. ΔF508 is the most common CFTR mutation found in PwCF among the 2,000 described CFTR mutations <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This mutation results in misfolding of CFTR, preventing it from getting to the cell surface, resulting in the cell being unable to secrete Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib03">(3)</link>. As many as 85% of PwCF have one copy of this mutation, with 44% being homozygotes <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib04">(4)</link>. No other variant has been found in more than 5% of PwCF <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The sweat chloride test is the most accurate test for the diagnosis of CF <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib05">(5)</link>. The principle of this test is that Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions secreted through non-CFTR Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ion channels in the sweat gland acinar region are reabsorbed through CFTR Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ion channels in the sweat ducts of normal individuals. In PwCF, these CFTR Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ion channels are not functional and do not appropriately reabsorb Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions, resulting in increased levels of Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions in sweat. The test is done by inducing sweating, collecting the sweat, and measuring its Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ion content. Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions are elevated in the sweat of PwCF. Mothers with infants with CF often report that the infant’s skin tastes salty, a hint that the child may have CF.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Two possible explanations exist for why the father screened negative for a CF gene. The parents were screened 9 years before their child with CF was born. At the time of his sibling's birth, his mother was a carrier of the most common CF gene, ΔF508, while his father was negative for abnormal CF genes. However, this testing was done when only a fraction of the 2,000 CF genes were known. Subsequent CF genotyping revealed that the father was a carrier of a CF gene that was only recently discovered <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib06">(6)</link>. At that time, this novel mutation had been found in only 24 PwCF globally. Alternatively, he may not have been the biologic father. That possibility was eliminated by improved CF genotyping.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  There are two important findings in this Gram stain. The red arrow is pointing toward a polymorphonuclear cell (PMN), or neutrophil. The PMN has darkly staining structures, which are nuclear material. There are other similarly shaped bodies in the Gram stain, but they do not contain nuclear material. These are likely degraded PMNs. Increased numbers of PMNs in sputum are characteristic of inflammation, a common occurrence in chronic lung infections. The blue arrow shows a microcolony of the organism in <link linkend="ch0071s0004fg02">Fig. 68.2</link>. Note that the darkly staining reddish-pink structures are Gram-negative rods. They are embedded in an amorphous lighter pink material. This amorphous pink material is a polysaccharide called alginate. Microcolonies are a collection of bacterial cells embedded in a polysaccharide. These microcolonies grow as biofilms on the thick, sticky mucus found in bronchi of PwCF <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>The slimy, coalescing lactose-negative colonies seen on the Mac Conkey plate are characteristic of mucoid <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib07">(7)</link>. The colonies have a distinctive grape-like odor, which is familiar to clinical microbiologists. The wet, mucoid appearance is a unique morphotype and due to hundreds of millions of bacteria being encased in an alginate matrix.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Abnormalities in CFTR cause blockage of Cl<superscript>–</superscript> secretion in epithelial cells, including those lining the airways. Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions attract water, hydrating the mucus overlaying ciliated epithelial cells. When Cl<superscript>–</superscript> secretion is blocked, the mucus becomes dehydrated <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib08">(8)</link>. This leads to sticky, thick mucus that inhibits ciliary clearance of inhaled particles, including bacteria. Certain bacteria have evolved to live in this thick, sticky mucus. Many of them are commensal anaerobic bacteria, which are aspirated from the oral cavity. These organisms are likely nonpathogenic in this niche, nor likely to elicit an inflammatory response. They may also protect against the establishment of chronic infection by more pathogenic organisms. However, it is well recognized that certain organisms become predominant in the bronchial ecosystem of PwCF, establishing chronic infection, and once established are almost impossible to eradicate. These organisms, many of which are resistant to multiple antimicrobials, include <emphasis>S. aureus, Burkholderia cepacia</emphasis> complex which is highly pathogenic in PwCF<emphasis>, <emphasis>Mycobacterium abscessus</emphasis> </emphasis>complex; and the organism seen in <link linkend="ch0071s0004fg01">Fig. 68.1</link> and <link linkend="ch0071s0004fg02">Fig. 68.2</link>, <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>. <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> is the organism most commonly associated with chronic CF lung disease and, as a result, the best studied of these pathogens. Acquisition of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> typically occurs from the PwCF’s environment, although there are reports of person-to-person spread of highly drug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib07">(7)</link>. The initial strains that infect PwCF grow planktonically as single cells. Random mutations in specific genes lead to <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> strains in which virulence factor production is downregulated and polysaccharide alginate production is upregulated. Alginate is a key component in establishing a biofilm mode of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> growth in the airways. The organism grows in a multicellular community encased by alginate, which protects it from both the PwCF’s immune response and antimicrobial therapy, allowing the establishment of a chronic infection <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antimicrobial that acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It cannot be absorbed orally. It is commonly used to treat infections with P. aeruginosa in part because this organism is resistant to a wide array of antimicrobials, but, at least early in the course of chronic infection, is susceptible to tobramycin. It is given either parenterally or, in CF, by aerosol. Studies have shown that intermittent, aerosolized tobramycin can eradicate <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> in some patients, or delay chronic infection, pulmonary exacerbations, and declining lung function associated with it <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib09">(9)</link>. It is not given continuously for three reasons.</para>
        <para>First, inhalation therapy takes time each day, making compliance less certain if it is given continuously. Intermittent therapy reduces the burden of care for both the PwCF and their care providers, who are frequently family members.</para>
        <para>Second, there is concern that the likelihood of developing antimicrobial resistance is greater if the drug is given continuously<link linkend="ch0071s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para>Third, tobramycin can be both nephrotoxic (leading to renal failure) and ototoxic (contributing to hearing loss). Reducing exposure to the drug lessens the likelihood of these adverse effects.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib11">(11)</link>. It can be given orally or parenterally. It acts by binding to and inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrases, which are essential in bacterial replication. Ciprofloxacin is unusual because it is active against <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> when given orally. Like tobramycin, it can be used intermittently to suppress <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> infection <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib11">(11)</link>. In fact, it is frequently combined with aerosolized tobramycin to eradicate, suppress, or treat chronic <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> infections. Advantages of ciprofloxacin compared to tobramycin are that it is easier to administer (oral versus aerosol) and is less toxic. Unfortunately, resistance to both agents occurs during chronic therapy.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Azithromycin is a macrolide antimicrobial that is typically administered orally <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib12">(12)</link>. It acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It is typically used to treat infections due to Gram-positive organisms and selected Gram-negative ones. All strains of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> are intrinsically resistant to this agent. Paradoxically, it has been found to be particularly effective in PwCF chronically infected with <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>. It acts by suppressing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine production in the airways of PwCF with chronic P. aeruginosa airway infections <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Inflammation plays a central role in damaging the airways during these infections. It may also inhibit synthesis of the organism’s virulence factors, impacting the virulence of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) is highly purified recombinant human DNase <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Human DNA released from PMNs during inflammation associated with chronic CF lung infection contributes to viscosity of mucus in the CF airway. Dornase alfa decreases that viscosity and, when used with hypertonic saline and lung percussion, helps mobilize airway secretions during airway clearance therapy so they can be expectorated.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">12.</emphasis>  Albuterol is a bronchodilator, which is used to “open” the airways during airway clearance therapy. Almost all CF patients use a bronchodilator because infection/inflammation induces bronchial constriction <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib04">(4)</link>. By relaxing/dilating the airways, bronchodilators allow respiratory secretions to be more easily expectorated.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">13.</emphasis>  Lung percussive therapy has been a mainstay of care in PwCF for decades <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>. It can be done manually and is begun in infancy. Manual percussive therapy requires a care provider to percuss areas of the chest and back to “loosen” airway secretions. It can take up to 40 minutes. Twice-daily percussive therapy, accompanied by concurrent hypertonic saline, albuterol, and dornase alfa treatments, is the norm. The patient does “huff” coughing in order to expectorate airway secretions intermittently throughout the therapy <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib14">(14)</link>. The advantage of the percussive vest is that the PwCF can do it independently and the actual percussion is consistent and reproducible. The device is expensive and bulky to move because the required compressor can weigh 10 to 30 lb.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">14.</emphasis>  Hypertonic saline increases the hydration of mucus, improving airway clearance <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib15">(15)</link>. It currently is used by approximately 70% of PwCF <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib04">(4)</link>. This therapy is fairly new, only becoming widely recommended during his adolescence.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">15.</emphasis>  Avibactam is a novel non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor used in combination with the third-generation cephalosporin ceftazidime <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Ceftazidime is initially active against most <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> isolates recovered from the airways of PwCF, but resistance may develop due to the acquisition of certain beta-lactamases, enzymes that degrade it. Other resistance mechanisms may also result in ceftazidime resistance. Ceftazidime, like all beta-lactam antimicrobials, inhibits cell wall synthesis and is bactericidal. Avibactam acts to “rescue” ceftazidime from the action of beta-lactamases that a bacterium might make, preserving ceftazidime’s activity. Given that the patient received many courses of beta-lactam antimicrobials, it is likely that his <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> strain was now resistant to ceftazidime alone. In a small study of multidrug-resistant (MDR) <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> strains from PwCF, it was found that ceftazidime-avibactam was active against 71% of isolates, while none of the other tested beta-lactams was active against more than 30% of the isolates <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib16">(16)</link>. All of the isolates were resistant to ceftazidime alone. Of the 29% of isolates resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam, eight of nine were resistant to all the antimicrobials tested. The mechanism of resistance was determined for the nine ceftazidime-avibactam–resistant organisms. None produced beta-lactamase that degraded ceftazidime. Pan-resistant organisms are typically seen only after decades of antimicrobial therapy with an array of antimicrobials. However, person-to-person spread of highly drug-resistant organisms is well recognized in the CF community, making infection prevention a central tenet of CF care <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">16.</emphasis>  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial folate metabolism. Folate metabolism is central to bacterial pyrimidine synthesis. This two-component antimicrobial blocks different steps of folate metabolism, and in combination the two agents are bactericidal. This antimicrobial is active against both Gram-positive and -negative organisms, the fungus <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis>, and the protozoan <emphasis>Toxoplasma gondii</emphasis>. It is typically not active against <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>, so it is unlikely it was being used to treat this organism. Rather, this antimicrobial is one of the more active antimicrobials against <emphasis>S. maltophilia</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib17">(17)</link>. It was likely being used to treat this organism, although the importance of this organism in chronic lung infection in PwCF is debated <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib18">(18)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">17.</emphasis>  Colistin is a polymyxin antimicrobial <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib19">(19)</link>. It acts by disrupting the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and as such is not active against Gram-positive ones. Colistin is considered an “antimicrobial of last resort” against MDR organisms in PwCF, especially MDR <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>. Since he was switched to aerosolized colistin from tobramycin previously and received ceftazidime-avibactam, it is clear that he had an MDR strain of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>. Colistin is considered an antimicrobial of last resort because it is highly nephrotoxic, especially when given intravenously <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib19">(19)</link>. The renal failure that occurred during IV colistin therapy is a too common complication. His need for 2 months of renal dialysis highlights the potential complications associated with complex treatment regimens common in PwCF.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">18.</emphasis>  The clinical course described in this case is all too common in PwCF. When <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> is first detected in a PwCF, attempts are made to eradicate it by treating the P. aeruginosa-positive individual with aerosolized tobramycin <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Some <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>-positive PwCF may also receive oral ciprofloxacin, although its utility is uncertain <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib09">(9)</link>. The longer patients can remain <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> free, the better the prognosis. Much of his care was focused on preserving lung function by suppressing <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> with aerosolized and oral antimicrobials augmented by daily airway clearance to disrupt the <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> environmental niche in the airways.</para>
        <para>Eventually, though, he developed a chronic <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> pulmonary infection. These infections are associated with periods of relative clinical quiescence followed by periods of worsening clinical symptoms called pulmonary exacerbations <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib20">(20)</link>. Pulmonary exacerbations are characterized by fever, increased cough, sputum production, increased respiratory rate, malaise, weight loss, and declining FEV1 (% predicted). What triggers pulmonary exacerbations is unclear <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib20">(20)</link>. It is theorized that viral infections, changes in microbiota, or some signal that causes a release of planktonic cells from the biofilm act to upregulate inflammation in the lung. A central tenet of chronic infection in CF is that inflammation plays an important role not only in the exacerbation of clinical symptoms but also in damaging the lung architecture, specifically the bronchial walls, resulting in bronchiectasis <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib21">(21)</link>. Pulmonary exacerbations are treated for 2 weeks with a combination of two antipseudomonal antimicrobials, most frequently tobramycin and an antipseudomonal beta-lactam antimicrobial such as ceftazidime. Dual therapy is used to try to prevent the emergence of resistance. Drug resistance emerged for the standard antipseudomonal therapeutic agents, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime. This resulted in using drugs of last resort such as colistin.</para>
        <para>Antimicrobial treatment of CF pulmonary exacerbations does not cure chronic P. aeruginosa infections. Rather, it reduces clinical symptoms and may restore some but typically not all lung function. Once chronic infection is established, damage to lung architecture is relentless; lung function is lost over a period of years to decades, eventually leading to lung transplantation or death.</para>
        <para>Despite his very aggressive therapy, he had progressively worsening lung function, reaching an FEV1 (% predicted) nadir in the 30s in his late teens during a pulmonary exacerbation, a point at which the CF Foundation recommends a lung transplant consultation<link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">19.</emphasis>  The small molecules elexacaftor, ivacaftor, and tezacaftor in Trikafta correct three different defects on the surface of CFTR-mutant bronchial cells <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib22">(22)</link>. Ivacaftor opens Cl<superscript>–</superscript> ions in specific <emphasis>CFTR</emphasis> mutants, while elexacaftor and tezacaftor correct protein-folding errors, particularly in ΔF508 <emphasis>CFTR</emphasis>mutants. Treatment with the combination of these three molecules in patients with at least one copy of ΔF508 (85% of the U. S. PwCF population) has shown significant improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1 (% predicted) and reduced sweat chloride levels<link linkend="ch0071s0002bib22">(22)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">20.</emphasis>  Since Trikafta has only been widely used in PwCF since 2019, there is limited information on its impact on chronic infection with <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>. How do we explain the two remarkable findings in this patient, an FEV1 (% predicted) of 80, which indicates normal lung function, and the absence of <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>? A possible explanation is that treatment with Trikafta has changed the surface of the bronchial ciliated epithelial cells from one covered with a thick, sticky mucus, ideal for the growth of mucoid <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>, to one with a more “normal” mucus. This change results in improved mucociliary clearance and innate immunity. The combination of the two has resulted in the elimination of chronic P. aeruginosa infection, a reduction in accompanying inflammation, and improvement in pulmonary function. As the PwCF described in this case stated, “This is a miracle drug” <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para>Since the widespread use of Trikafta starting in 2019 in those over 6 years of age, there has been a marked decline in those infected with <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Some of this decline could be due to reduced exposure to <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> due to COVID-19 control measures and fewer in-person CF clinic visits, reducing the risk of person-to-person spread of this organism, but some is likely to be due to the impact of Trikafta on CF lung function.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">21.</emphasis>   A 2023 study modeling life expectancy of PwCF who began receiving Trikafta at 12 to 17 years of age predicted a near normal life span of 71 years versus one of 38 years for those not receiving the drug <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib23">(23)</link>. Since the drug is now available starting at 2 years of age, adult CF care providers are planning on long-term care in PwCF for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic bone disease such as osteoporosis, and gastrointestinal malignancy <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1, 24</link>).</para>
        <para>This patient’s FEV1 (% predicted) in the 80s, his not being hospitalized for 2 years after being hospitalized four times in the year prior to beginning this therapy, and his no longer being infected with <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> portend an extended life span for this individual. As more experience is gained with the use of this drug, the patient may no longer need to take azithromycin nor perform daily airway clearance procedures.</para>
        <para>This is the first generation of CFTR modulators. There may be improved therapies in development, but it is clear that Trikafta is a life-changing therapy for the vast majority of PwCF.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">22.</emphasis>  First, the drug costs well over $200,000 a year, making it cost-prohibitive in much of the world <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para>Second, since this drug must be taken daily for the rest of the individual’s life, drug compliance may become a challenge, especially because the patient’s quality of life will be so improved they will no longer “feel sick,” or, as this patient commented, “Is this breathing?”<link linkend="ch0071s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para>Third, since this drug is so new, potential adverse effects due to long-term treatment are not known.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">23.</emphasis>  A significant shortcoming of the currently available CFTR modulators is that they are not active in approximately 10% of PwCF <link linkend="ch0071s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This group of PwCF have a wide array of rare mutations, making designing additional genetic modulators that may treat a small portion of the remaining CF population and proving their efficacy cost prohibitive.</para>
