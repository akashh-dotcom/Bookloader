        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  In the United States, the most likely diagnosis is either genital herpes or syphilis, the latter of which has been on the rise <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib01">(1)</ulink>. In studies of patients with genital lesions in the industrialized world, HSV is the most frequently recovered agent. Other agents that are common causes of genital lesions include <emphasis>Haemophilus ducreyi</emphasis> (the etiologic agent of chancroid), human papillomavirus (genital warts), and the lymphogranuloma venereum-causing serotypes of <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis>. Genital herpes lesions are painful, whereas lesions due to <emphasis>Treponema pallidum</emphasis> are usually painless. Genital infections such as chancroid or lymphogranuloma venereum can result in painful or painless ulcers, respectively, but they often result in suppurative lymphadenopathy.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The diagnosis of HSV infection can be made by swabbing the base of the lesion and performing a NAAT <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib02">(2)</ulink>. NAATs, whether FDA-approved/-cleared assays or laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), have largely replaced antigen testing and viral culture due to improved sensitivity and rapid turnaround time. Approved indications for FDA-approved HSV NAATs are limited, with most restricted to mucocutaneous or genital lesions from adults. Therefore, use of LDTs or modification of FDA-approved assays is common to facilitate testing in children and accept a wider array of specimen types, e. g. CSF, blood, and neonatal surface swabs. When using molecular testing it is important to maintain a strict quality control system capable of detecting laboratory contamination, as lesion samples contain high viral titers. Tzanck preparations, in which smears taken from the edge of the lesion are examined for the presence of cells showing pathologic changes consistent with HSV infection, can also be used in the diagnosis of genital lesions. This technique, although inexpensive, lacks both sensitivity and specificity and has become largely obsolete. HSV was detected in this patient by an HSV NAAT performed on a swab of her genital lesion, which was positive for HSV-2.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  HSV, like all herpesviruses, causes a lifelong, latent infection. In genital tract infections, the virus enters a latent state in the sacral nerve ganglia. Recurrences happen when the virus replicates in the neuron and is carried along the peripheral nerves to the epithelium. Of adults with HSV-2, only 10 to 25% have a clinical history of genital herpes lesions. HSV-infected individuals can intermittently shed HSV without symptoms and contribute to the transmission of HSV. Both condom use and antiviral suppression decrease transmission. Symptomatic recurrences may occur as frequently as 8 to 10 times per year, although most individuals have much fewer episodes. Recurrences are generally milder than the primary episode of disease.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  HSV-2 infects ~12% of individuals in the United States <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib03">(3)</ulink>. Infections are more common in females (15.9%) than in males (8.2%) and are most common in non-Hispanic black individuals (34.6%) <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib04">(4)</ulink>. Other risk factors for HSV-2 infection include early age of first sexual encounter, a high number of sexual partners, history of other sexually transmitted infections, and lower socioeconomic status. Infection rates among commercial sex workers may approach 100%. Although HSV-2 infection rates increased significantly from 1976 to 1994, with the highest rate of increase in individuals &lt;30 years old, this trend has reversed with an overall decline in all demographic categories since 1999.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  This patient’s lumbar puncture is indicative of aseptic meningitis, with a lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose, and elevated protein. HSV is on the top of the differential, given active genital HSV-2. Among women with primary genital herpes due to HSV-2, approximately one in three will have self-limited, aseptic meningitis. Similar to lesion testing, NAATs have replaced culture for detection of HSV from CSF, showing improved sensitivity with the molecular method <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib02">(2)</ulink>. Therefore, HSV NAAT of CSF has become the standard method for diagnosing HSV central nervous system (CNS) infection. When CSF cultures were standard laboratory practice, the rate of isolation of HSV-2 was 0.5 to 3.0% in patients with aseptic meningitis. Now that molecular testing of CSF is the reference method, the rate of detection of HSV-2 has increased to 5 to 17% <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib05">(5)</ulink>. As mentioned previously, lesion swabs can have very high amounts of virus. It is good laboratory practice to separate testing of lesions from CSF to avoid laboratory contamination and the risk of false-positive results on CSF samples. An HSV NAAT from CSF was positive for HSV-2.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The VDRL test is a microflocculation nontreponemal test most commonly used for evaluation of neurosyphilis <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib06">(6)</ulink>. The assay detects antibodies to host-derived antigen released during infections with <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis>. Notably, it does detect antibodies directed toward organism-specific antigens, a key distinction with treponemal tests. Despite a negative serum RPR, CSF-VDRL is still warranted in cases where neurosyphilis is on the differential, as there are instances where only the CSF-VDRL is reactive (see <ulink url="ch0060.xml#ch0060">case 57</ulink>) <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib07">(7)</ulink>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Intravenous acyclovir is the recommended therapy for patients with HSV meningitis <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib08">(8)</ulink>. With clinical improvement, therapy can be switched to an oral regimen for a total duration of 10–14 days.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Resistance to acyclovir should be considered in patients with persistent or recurrent lesions while on therapy. This is uncommon during acute infection and primarily impacts those with underlying immunodeficiency and prolonged exposure to acyclovir, commonly administered for prophylactic purposes.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  The mechanism of action of acyclovir begins with phosphorylation of acyclovir by viral thymidine kinase (TK) and ultimately the formation of acyclovir triphosphate. This molecule functions as a competitive inhibitor, halting the function of the viral DNA polymerase. The overwhelming majority of HSV resistance to acyclovir is due to mutations in the TK (<emphasis>UL23</emphasis> gene) and rarely due to mutations in the DNA polymerase (<emphasis>UL30</emphasis> gene). Mutations in <emphasis>UL23</emphasis> can knock out TK activity entirely or cause reduced efficiency of acyclovir phosphorylation <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib09">(9)</ulink>.</para>
        <para>Antiviral susceptibility testing is the one area of HSV diagnostics where viral culture remains the standard. Testing is performed using a plaque reduction assay. Briefly, this method relies on the cytopathic effect of HSV-infected cells producing “plaques,” or clearings, within the cell culture monolayer. The virus is grown in cell culture with increasing concentrations of acyclovir. The number of plaques produced in the presence of drug are compared to the number of plaques in culture without drug. The acyclovir concentration resulting in a 50% reduction of plaque formation is the inhibitory dose (ID<subscript>50</subscript>). HSV is considered susceptible to acyclovir if the ID<subscript>50</subscript> is &lt;2 μg/ml <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib09">(9)</ulink>. Limitations of phenotypic cell culture susceptibility testing include the amount of viable virus needed to perform testing, slow turnaround time for results (3 weeks), and evidence in some patient populations that susceptibility results may not correlate with clinical cure <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib09">(9)</ulink>. More recently, sequencing of the <emphasis>UL23</emphasis> gene has been used to detect mutations and predict antiviral resistance <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib10">(10)</ulink>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Her fetus would be at risk for neonatal herpes. Neonatal herpes is a relatively infrequent infection, with an estimated 1,200–1,500 cases per year <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib11">(11)</ulink>. However, it is estimated that 25 to 50% of women who have acquired HSV during pregnancy and have vaginal deliveries will transmit the disease to their child, whereas ≤1% with recurrent infection will do so. Notably, most cases of genital HSV in women are asymptomatic, though cervical viral shedding still occurs. Other factors that increase the likelihood of infection are prolonged rupture of membranes, a mother who is seronegative for HSV-2 (suggesting acute infection), and the use of fetal scalp monitors. Of neonates with herpes infections, ~80% are infected during passage through an infected birth canal, while ~6 to 14% are infected <emphasis>in utero</emphasis> and the remaining are infected postpartum <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib12">(12)</ulink>.</para>
        <para>Most neonatal HSV infections occur in the second to third week of life. There are three forms of neonatal HSV infection: (i) skin, eyes, and mouth disease; (ii) CNS disease; and (iii) disseminated disease. The most benign form, which is seen in 45% of cases, causes infection localized to the skin, eyes, and mouth. If recognized, it can be effectively treated with antiviral agents such as acyclovir. CNS-associated infections account for 30% of cases. These children have nonspecific CNS symptoms not unlike those of neonatal bacterial meningitis, including seizures, lethargy, high fevers, poor feeding, and irritation. Lesions may or may not be present. Mortality approaches 50% in untreated children, and long-term neurologic sequelae such as developmental delay, epilepsy, blindness, and cognitive disabilities are seen in half of the survivors. The most severe manifestation of disease is disseminated infection, which occurs in ~25% of cases. In this infection, multiple organs, including the brain, may be infected. These individuals typically have a viral exanthem in the setting of CNS infection and/or multiorgan failure. Up to 50% of cases do not have a rash. If the infection is untreated, mortality is very high, reaching 80%. Even with appropriate therapy, mortality for disseminated disease is 30%, and those who survive often have profound neurologic sequelae as mentioned above.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists provides guidance on the management of genital herpes during pregnancy <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib11">(11)</ulink>. For patients with active herpetic lesions during pregnancy, both primary or recurrent infection, treatment with acyclovir is recommended for 5 or 10 days depending on the specific presentation and severity of infection. Cesarean delivery is also recommended for patients with active genital lesions at the time of birth, reducing the risk of exposure for the baby. For patients with known history of HSV, but without active lesions, suppressive acyclovir can be offered after 36 weeks gestation as prophylaxis prior to delivery.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">12.</emphasis>  There are two distinct serotypes of HSV—HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 is an infection primarily of the oropharyngeal mucosa, with latent infection occurring in the trigeminal ganglion, while HSV-2 primarily infects the genital mucosa, though either serotype can be seen in these anatomic sites. HSV-1 infections are typically acquired in early childhood, while HSV-2 infections occur after the individual becomes sexually active. There has been a noticeable increase in HSV-1 genital infections, with possible explanations for this increase including increased oral-genital contact; increased HSV-1 acquisition in childhood, providing more viral exposure in adolescence; and/or a decrease in HSV-1 infection in childhood, making children more susceptible when they become sexually active <ulink url="ch0007.xml#ch0007s0002bib13">(13)</ulink>. Although both serotypes are neurotropic, HSV-1 appears to cause more severe CNS infection affecting the temporal and frontal lobes. In contrast to aseptic meningitis associated with primary genital HSV-2 infection and neonatal CNS infection, herpes encephalitis in adults and older children is most often due to HSV-1 infection. Herpes encephalitis is a rare, sporadic CNS viral infection and is the most common cause of non-epidemic viral encephalitis in adults in the United States. Patients present with fever, headache and encephalopathic findings such as altered consciousness, behavioral and speech disturbances, and focal or diffuse neurologic signs. It is not clear why certain patterns of CNS infection with either HSV-1 or HSV-2 result in different CNS manifestations. The age of the patient, the route of viral dissemination (e. g., neural versus hematogenous), preexisting immunity, and/or specific viral properties may be factors.</para>
