        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  COPD is a condition in which the small airways (bronchioles and alveoli) are irreversibly damaged by inflammation <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This condition is most frequently due to chronic inhalation of toxic particulates, most commonly cigarette smoke, wood smoke, or air pollutants, particularly industrial ones. This damage typically occurs over decades of exposure to these lung irritants, so COPD is usually observed in individuals over 40 years of age. Patients may present with either emphysema or chronic bronchitis, depending on where damage occurs in the lung. This damage may result in narrowing small airways, adversely impacting gas exchange. Clinically, individuals with COPD may have a combination of chronic cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance. Over time, individuals with COPD have reduced lung function, which may require chronic oxygen supplementation, as was seen in this individual.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  This patient had a pulmonary exacerbation of his COPD. COPD exacerbations are characterized by dyspnea, cough, fever, and increased sputum production. Corticosteroids, which he was receiving along with increased oxygen supplementation and oral antimicrobials, are standard therapy for these pulmonary exacerbations. The pathogenesis of these exacerbations is due to increased inflammation, most commonly associated with either bacterial or viral infections <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Guidelines recommend the use of oral antimicrobials in individuals with mild COPD exacerbations: ampicillin-clavulanic acid, doxycycline, azithromycin, or, in patients in whom drug resistance may be of concern, fluoroquinolones <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not recommended in current guidelines. However, it is an oral antimicrobial that is used to treat bacterial respiratory illnesses. It may be that the physician had previous success using this antimicrobial in this setting, perhaps even in this patient.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Because inflammation plays an important role in COPD exacerbation, a common treatment strategy in this clinical setting is to start or increase the dosage of corticosteroids for those already using them.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  A key pathogen in COPD exacerbation that leads to hospitalization is <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Mortality is significantly higher in COPD patients who have pulmonary exacerbations with <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Oral antimicrobials are generally not effective in treating <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> pulmonary infections. Current empiric antimicrobial treatment regimens for <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis> community-acquired pulmonary infections include piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, or imipenem <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib04">(4)</link>. The physician’s local antibiogram will provide data for which one of these agents is most likely to be active against <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Three common types of helminth larvae pass through the lung as part of their life cycle: <emphasis>Ascaris lumbricoides</emphasis>, hookworm (<emphasis>Necator americanus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ancylostoma duodenale</emphasis>), and <emphasis>Strongyloides stercoralis</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib05">(5)</link>. The findings of filariform larvae in sputum and the development of gastrointestinal symptoms after an increase in the patient’s corticosteroid dose are consistent with hyperinfection with <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis>. Both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms can occur in <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> hyperinfection <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> is obtained most frequently by barefooted individuals who step in an area that is contaminated with human feces containing the filariform larval form of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Hookworm (<emphasis>N. americanus</emphasis> and <emphasis>A. duodenale</emphasis>) is obtained in a similar manner. In high-income countries that have high sanitary levels, this is an unusual occurrence. However, the prevalence of this parasite is higher in rural areas of Appalachia, a region where outhouses were common during this individual’s youth, when he likely became infected (see <phrase>answer to question 8</phrase> for further explanation). It is estimated that between 300 million and 600 million people are infected with this organism globally, with the highest rates in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. In the United States, 15% of the population are migrants, many from countries with high rates of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> infection <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  This parasite has a complex life cycle, with autoinfection being a prominent feature. Two larval forms are central to its life cycle: the filariform larva (the infective form) and the rhabditiform larva (the initial form of the worm, which develops into the filariform larva). The life cycle begins with filariform larvae penetrating the skin when individuals with bare feet step on soil contaminated with human feces <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib05">(5)</link>. The larvae migrate via the bloodstream to the lung, where they break through the walls of the alveoli, crawl out of the bronchus and up the trachea, are swallowed, and because the larvae are resistant to stomach acid, reach the duodenum. There the parasite develops into an adult worm that invades and lives beneath the intestinal wall mucosa. Only female worms are present, and they reproduce by parthenogenesis. Eggs hatch as rhabditiform larvae. Most of these larvae are passed in feces. If feces are passed onto soil, either the rhabditiform larvae develop into filariform (infectious) larvae, and the cycle begins anew, or they develop into adult worms. These adult worms lay eggs in the soil that hatch into rhabditiform larvae and develop into filariform larvae. An important phase of the <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> life cycle in the hyperinfection state is the autoinfective stage <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib05">(5)</link>. In this stage, rhabditiform larvae develop into filariform larvae in the intestinal tract. The filariform larvae then penetrate either the intestinal wall or the perianal skin, enter the bloodstream, migrate to the lung, and begin the infectious process again. It is estimated that the parasite can live for 30 or 40 years in the human gastrointestinal tract. The ability of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> to complete its entire life cycle within the human host is very unusual for a nematode, and it is this autoinfective cycle, plus the adult worm living within the intestinal mucosa rather than at the mucosal surface, that contributes to this parasite’s unusual longevity in the human host.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>   Although the parasite may persist for many years, the parasite-host relationship appears to be balanced by the immune system. Infected, immunocompetent individuals frequently are asymptomatic, or they may have intermittent symptoms, which usually are gastrointestinal, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib05">(5)</link>. A few patients might have intermittent “larva currens” (racing larvae), characterized by itching and skin rash. However, when patients receive corticosteroids, the balance between host and parasite is tilted in favor of the parasite. A possible explanation for this shift is a corticosteroid metabolite that has a similar structure to the hormone 20-hydroxydecone <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib06">(6)</link>. This hormone promotes the transformation of rhabditiform larvae to filariform larvae. It is possible that this corticosteroid metabolite may be able to shift the life cycle of the parasite to increase the number of filariform larvae, driving increased autoinfection. The host’s worm burden increases dramatically, aided by autoinfection. This sharp increase in the number of parasites, with corresponding severe clinical disease due to tissue invasion by <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> larvae, is called the hyperinfection syndrome. Patients with hyperinfection syndrome frequently begin with worsening gastrointestinal symptoms similar to but more severe than those in symptomatic, immunocompetent individuals. These patients also may have cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and an abnormal chest radiograph, and they can rapidly progress to respiratory failure, as was seen in this case <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib06">(6)</link>. As these bacterially laden larvae move through the bloodstream and the central nervous system, the blood and cerebrospinal fluid can become contaminated with bacteria, primarily enteric Gram-negative bacilli, carried by the larvae, resulting in bacterial sepsis and meningitis.</para>
        <para>Hyperinfection with <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is a life-threatening infection with a mortality rate of 50% in pulmonary infections and 70% in disseminated ones <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Hyperinfection is treated with oral ivermectin. Typically, patients with hyperinfection are treated for 10 to 14 days, with treatment continuing until stool specimens are negative for larvae for several days <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib06">(6)</link>. If the patient is on a ventilator and cannot receive ivermectin orally, the treatment regimen becomes more complex. There is no intravenous form of ivermectin available for humans, only veterinary formulations. This formulation has been used subcutaneously, but proper dosing is not established.</para>
        <para>During the pandemic, the use of ivermectin to “treat” COVID-19 found favor in some groups. However, careful data analysis of several clinical trials showed no benefit for ivermectin in treating COVID-19<link linkend="ch0022s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Why the conflict? A meta-analysis of ivermectin COVID-19 treatment trials from areas of low and high prevalence of strongyloidiasis showed a benefit only in areas of high strongyloidiasis prevalence <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib08">(8)</link>. This suggests that the benefit observed may have been due to the treatment of unrecognized strongyloidiasis hyperinfections, especially in patients who were being treated with corticosteroids.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  Hyperinfection due to <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> is of concern in patients who are organ transplant candidates because they will receive long-term immunosuppressive therapy <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib09">(9)</link>. This therapy suppresses cell-mediated immunity, which is essential for immunoregulation of  <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infection. SOT recipients can develop hyperinfection in two ways <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib09">(9)</link>. One is to receive an infected organ. Second, they can be chronically infected with this parasite. Pretransplant, individuals who are at high risk for chronic strongyloidiasis should be tested for this organism. This includes those who have lived in areas in which the helminth is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and South America and the southeastern United States <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Screening is done by testing for antibodies to <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis>. If positive, the patient is treated with 2 days of ivermectin even though the test may give false positives due to the cross-reaction with other helminths. It is important to note that serology cannot differentiate between current and prior infection, so treatment of a seropositive transplant candidate is done strictly as a precautionary measure. By comparison, stool exam in all but hyperinfection states, such as occurred in this patient, is insensitive and does not reliably detect low-grade infections <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib06">(6)</link>. The use of repeated stool examination has been shown to increase the sensitivity of <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> detection but not to the level of serology. However, stool examination is the only way to detect current infection. The use of the agar plate culture technique has been shown to be more sensitive for the detection of <emphasis>S. stercoralis</emphasis> than routine stool examination techniques <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib06">(6)</link>. In this method, stool is placed on sterile agar plates, and the presence of characteristic furrows in areas of bacterial growth due to the migration of the parasites on the surface of the agar is sought.</para>
        <para><emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> serology should also be done on both living and deceased donors who are likely to be at risk for chronic <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infection <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib09">(9)</link>. If the serology is positive, the organ recipient should be treated with ivermectin immediately. It is unclear how often this testing is actually done as part of donor screening. <emphasis>Strongyloides</emphasis> infection in either the donor or recipient is not considered to be a contraindication for transplantation <link linkend="ch0022s0002bib09">(9)</link>.</para>
