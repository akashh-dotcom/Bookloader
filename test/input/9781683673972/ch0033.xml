        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The patient’s elevated ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular injury. Although the patient was in recovery from alcohol use disorder, excessive alcohol consumption is associated with liver disease and cannot be ruled out as the source of his elevated liver enzymes. Given his nonspecific systemic symptoms that accompanied his abnormal laboratory tests, viral hepatitis is likely. The patient should be tested for antibodies to HAV, HBV, and HCV. If the patient had a travel history to Asia, Africa, the Middle East, or Central America, hepatitis E virus should be considered <link linkend="ch0033s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Other viruses that can cause an acute presentation with elevated liver enzymes include herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus <link linkend="ch0033s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The patient was not infected by HAV (indicated by negative HAV IgM) nor by HCV (negative HCV antibody). The interpretation of the serologic testing for HBV infection is of great clinical importance. Knowledge of the time course of the typical serologic patterns seen in acute infection (<link linkend="ch0033s0001fg01">Fig. 30.1</link>) and in patients who become chronic carriers of HBV after the initial infection (<link linkend="ch0033s0001fg01">Fig. 30.2</link>) is needed to interpret the serologic results. The positive HBsAg test, in combination with the positive HBc IgM antibody test, indicates that this patient had acute HBV infection (<link linkend="ch0033s0001ta01">Table 30.1</link>). The HBs antibody usually does not develop until at least 3 months postinfection, when there is a concomitant disappearance of HBsAg. The HBc total antibody test remains positive throughout the disease course because it detects both IgM and IgG antibodies. The presence of HBsAg indicates that the virus is actively replicating.</para>

        <para role="table-footnote"><superscript><emphasis>a</emphasis></superscript> Possible interpretations: (i) the patient may be recovering from acute HBV infection; (ii) the patient may be distantly immune, and the test is not sensitive enough to detect very low levels of anti-HBs in serum; (iii) the patient may be susceptible with a false-positive anti-HBc; and (iv) there may be an undetectable level of HBsAg present in the serum, and the patient is actually a carrier.</para>
        <para>The presentation of acute HBV infection ranges from subclinical to fulminant hepatitis. Approximately 70% of patients present with anicteric hepatitis, with the majority being asymptomatic<link linkend="ch0033s0002bib03">(3)</link>. However, ~30% of patients may have a variety of other symptoms including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, myalgia, fatigue, aversion to food and cigarettes, and RUQ and epigastric pain. Acute HBV presentation may be more severe in patients with underlying immune dysfunction, coinfection with other hepatitis viruses, and underlying liver disease. This patient had several symptoms consistent with his diagnosis of acute HBV infection, including anicteric hepatitis, RUQ pain, and myalgia. Although this patient had a risk factor for severe acute disease (potential liver disease from alcohol use), his presentation was relatively mild.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>HBeAg is a protein that is secreted by HBV-infected cells and is a marker of active viral replication. HBeAg generally appears within a week of HBsAg. In the natural progression of HBV infection, HBeAg is present for 3 to 6 weeks and then disappears before HBsAg. The disappearance of HBeAg is followed by the appearance of anti-HBeAg (seroconversion), which is associated with greatly reduced viral replication. Persistence of HBeAg indicates chronic HBV infection with active viral replication. However, mutations occur in the precore region and core promoter that render HBeAg negative or reduce its expression. Core promoter mutations are associated with more severe liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, treatment guidelines recommend a lower viral load threshold for treating HBeAg-negative disease relative to HBeAg-positive disease (i. e., 2,000 IU/ml versus 20,000 IU/ml, respectively)<link linkend="ch0033s0002bib04">(4)</link>. HBeAg-negative patients with chronic hepatitis B are twice as likely to develop cirrhosis as HBeAg-positive patients. HBeAg seroconversion is associated with sustained reductions in HBV DNA and lower rates of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B who are treated <link linkend="ch0033s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The patient presumably acquired his infection from an infected sexual partner <link linkend="ch0033s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Approximately 9 to 30% of individuals with chronic HBV are also infected with HCV. Thus, his HCV-positive partner could also have been coinfected with HBV, or perhaps the patient had additional risk factors that were not disclosed. HBV is more transmissible than HCV or HIV. Following percutaneous exposure to a known positive source, the risk of acquisition for HBV is approximately 1 in 3, while the risk for HCV is 1 in 30 and that for HIV-1 is 1 in 300. Of course, the risk depends on the viral load of the source and the type of body fluid exposure (e. g., mucocutaneous exposure carries a much lower risk of transmission than percutaneous exposure). HBV is found in the body fluids of infected individuals, including, most notably, blood and semen. In addition to sexual transmission, HBV can be acquired perinatally by an infant from an infected mother and via blood either directly (such as by transfusions of blood products prior to effective donor screening) or indirectly (such as by sharing contaminated needles). Needlestick injuries in health care workers are of particular concern, as HBV is transmitted more efficiently than HIV.</para>
        <para>There are an estimated 300 million chronic carriers of HBV worldwide, many of whom live in Asia. In Asian-Pacific countries, HBV is usually acquired either perinatally or by horizontal transmission in early childhood. This contrasts with the United States and Western Europe, where most individuals are infected as adults. Perinatal infection is not typically associated with an acute hepatitis clinical syndrome, but rather chronic HBV infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>Approximately 30% of adult patients who are infected with HBV have an acute illness characterized by jaundice due to elevated bilirubin, fatigue, and abnormal liver function tests (i. e., icteric hepatitis). Clinically, liver function tests indicative of hepatocellular injury (AST and ALT) are elevated in patients with acute hepatitis. Other tests of hepatic function, such as coagulation times, are typically abnormal because of a decrease in the hepatic synthesis of clotting factors. However, as noted in the<phrase>answer to question 2</phrase>, many patients with acute hepatitis B are asymptomatic or have anicteric hepatitis with a variety of other symptoms. While most infected patients will have a self-limiting illness, a small subset of acutely infected patients will develop fulminant hepatitis, which can be fatal. This is more likely to occur in those patients who are coinfected with hepatitis D virus, an RNA virus that requires the presence of HBV to replicate and cause an infection <link linkend="ch0033s0002bib06">(6)</link>. HBV genotype and environmental factors (acetaminophen, alcohol, and methamphetamine use) may also play a role in the development of fulminant hepatitis.</para>
        <para>The risk of developing chronic HBV infection is dependent on the age at initial infection<link linkend="ch0033s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Fewer than 5% of adults become chronically infected. This contrasts with infected neonates, 90% of whom will become chronic carriers, and children 1 to 5 years old, 20 to 50% of whom will become chronically infected. Chronic infection, associated with a significant rate of cirrhosis, may lead to end-stage liver disease and to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Other complications, due to immune complex formation, may result in extrahepatic manifestations, such as polyarteritis nodosa and other vasculitides. These can result in injury to the kidney, lung, and other organs. Coinfection with either HIV or HCV during chronic hepatitis B infection may lead to a more rapid disease progression (<link linkend="ch0033s0002bib07">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0033s0002bib08">8</link>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Only supportive treatment is recommended for acute HBV infection, since &gt;95% of immunocompetent adults will clear the infection naturally <link linkend="ch0033s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Patients with a more severe initial presentation (severe jaundice, encephalopathy, or coagulopathy) may require hospitalization. Although there are not randomized, placebo-controlled trials to support the use of antivirals in acute HBV infection, many physicians choose to treat patients with prolonged severe initial infection, fulminant hepatitis, immunodeficiency, coinfection with HCV or hepatitis D, or preexisting liver disease. Nucleos(t)ide-based therapy is preferred to interferon and should be discontinued when the patient’s HBsAg test is negative.</para>
        <para>HBV antiviral therapy is generally reserved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B to reduce the risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful treatment is indicated by the loss of HBsAg from the serum, but this occurs in a minority of patients with chronic infection. Sequential liver biopsies are used to monitor the progression of chronic liver disease. Histologic improvement can occur in patients who remain HBV carriers (indicated by a positive HBsAg test). This is likely due to decreased viral replication associated with nucleos(t)ide antiviral therapy, which is supported by decreased levels of HBV DNA detected in the serum.</para>
        <para>Drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B include pegylated alpha interferon and several nucleos(t)ide analogs (i. e., lamivudine, entacavir, telbivudine, adefovir, and tenofovir)<link linkend="ch0033s0002bib09">(9)</link>. HBV is unique in that its genome is composed of partially double-stranded DNA that is transcribed from covalently closed circular DNA to form pregenomic RNA. The nucleos(t)ide analogs are viral DNA polymerase inhibitors that act as chain terminators to prevent the reverse transcription of the HBV pregenomic RNA to DNA. Interferon therapy, which acts as an immunomodulator, is not known to be associated with the emergence of HBV mutations, whereas significant resistance rates have been observed with nucleos(t)ide therapy, particularly lamivudine monotherapy (16% at year 1, 61% at year 3). Therefore, combination therapy will likely become the most effective treatment for chronic HBV infection. Unfortunately, interferon therapy has a high rate of side effects and is more difficult to administer than the nucleos(t)ide drugs, which are administered orally.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  The most important method used to prevent HBV infection is immunization, which is given as a series of three intramuscular injections. Effective vaccines against HBV have been available since 1982 <link linkend="ch0033s0002bib10">(10)</link>. The initial vaccine was derived from individuals who were chronic carriers of HBV. The vaccine that is now in use is a recombinant vaccine. A subset of people do not respond to the vaccine (i. e., do not produce detectable antibodies to recombinant HBsAg). With repeat vaccinations, some of these individuals will respond, as demonstrated by the production of an adequate antibody level to HBsAg.</para>
        <para>The neutralizing antibodies that are produced following vaccination are directed to a hydrophilic region of the HBsAg. One concern is the development of vaccine-escape mutants of HBV. HBV mutations in the S gene that confer amino acid substitutions within the hydrophilic region of the surface antigen can allow the replication of HBV in people who have been vaccinated. Fortunately, these events are rare to date, and there has been no evidence of epidemiologic spread of vaccine-escape mutants even among close contacts. Nonetheless, if the frequency of these mutations increases, there could be a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine. Therefore, surveillance for vaccine-escape mutants is of great importance to assess the need for modification of the current vaccine.</para>
        <para>An additional method of protection, which is used in the setting of a known exposure to HBV in a nonimmune individual, is the use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG)<link linkend="ch0033s0002bib11">(11)</link>. For example, HBIG is given following a needlestick injury in a nonimmune individual (i. e., postexposure prophylaxis). Both vaccination and HBIG have been shown to decrease the rate of chronic infection due to HBV in infants born to mothers who are infected with HBV.</para>
