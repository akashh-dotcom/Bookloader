        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Ticks are vectors for <emphasis>Borrelia burgdorferi</emphasis> (the agent of Lyme disease), other <emphasis>Borrelia</emphasis> species (which cause relapsing fever), <emphasis>Francisella tularensis</emphasis> (the agent of tularemia), <emphasis>Babesia microti</emphasis> (the agent of babesiosis), <emphasis>Rickettsia rickettsii</emphasis> (the etiologic agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF]), <emphasis>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</emphasis> (causing human monocytic ehrlichiosis), <emphasis>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</emphasis> (the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis), Colorado tick fever virus, Powassan virus, and other rickettsiae and viruses not found in the United States. <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis> is endemic in North Carolina, with Oklahoma or North Carolina reporting the largest number of RMSF cases on a yearly basis. Ninety percent of cases occur between the months of April and September, a period when adult ticks, the stage that spreads the organism, are most actively feeding. For <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis> to be transmitted to humans, the infected tick must be attached for a minimum of 6 to 10 hours, and more than 24 hours may be required for transmission to occur. The incubation time after tick exposure ranges from 2 to 14 days, with a median of 7 days. The patient’s development of symptoms 8 days after tick exposure is consistent with <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis> infection. The American dog tick (<emphasis>Dermacentor variabilis</emphasis>) transmits RMSF in North Carolina <link linkend="ch0043s0002bib01">(1)</link>. In addition to RMSF, ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease are the other two most common tickborne diseases in North Carolina. <link linkend="ch0043s0001ta02">Table 40.1</link> lists a summary of ticks and the diseases they transmit within the United States <link linkend="ch0043s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  RMSF has been a reportable disease in the United States since 1920. However, commonly available serology tests used to diagnose <emphasis>Rickettsia</emphasis> are unable to differentiate between spotted fever group <emphasis>Rickettsia</emphasis> species. In 2010, the CDC modified reporting criteria so that cases of RMSF are now reported under a more general group, SFR <link linkend="ch0043s0002bib03">(3)</link>. This category captures various rickettsial diseases, including RMSF, <emphasis>Rickettsia parkeri</emphasis> rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, and rickettsialpox. While this general group is more inclusive, it can be difficult to ascertain which cases are RMSF versus other spotted fevers. The inclusion of RMSF with other less severe spotted fevers is likely responsible for the increase in reported incidence but decrease in case fatality rates. Overall, the decrease in fatality since the 1940s is directly attributable to the discovery and widespread use of tetracycline antibiotics.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Antibody titers for tickborne diseases are frequently negative within the first 7 to 10 days of illness <link linkend="ch0043s0002bib04">(4)</link>. One of the major problems with the serologic tests is that early in the disease course, the individual may not have mounted a sufficiently strong immune response to result in a positive serologic test result. Follow-up serologic tests 1 to 4 weeks later may prove to be positive. In patients in whom RMSF is a distinct possibility, a negative serologic test result should not preclude the use of antimicrobial therapy since a fulminant, fatal disease course with this organism may occur. An acute positive <emphasis>Ehrlichia</emphasis> IgG suggests exposure to the pathogen, but recent or current infection should be confirmed by convalescent serum testing, which should show a 4-fold increase in IgG titer if the infection is recent or current.</para>

        <para role="table-footnote"><superscript><emphasis>a</emphasis></superscript> Modified from Rodino KG, Theel ES, Pritt BS. 2020. <emphasis>Clin Chem</emphasis> 66:537–548, with permission.</para>
        <para role="table-footnote"><superscript><emphasis>b</emphasis></superscript> <emphasis>R. sanguineus</emphasis> is found throughout the United States, but has only been reported to transmit spotted fever rickettsiosis in the southwestern United States, and along the United States-Mexico border.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The most likely etiology of the patient’s infection is <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis>, which causes RMSF. The physical finding of erythema, in the presence of fever, myalgia, and diarrhea, with a history of a tick bite in a geographically compatible area, is highly suggestive of RMSF. Although this patient did not have it, hyponatremia (low Na<superscript>+</superscript> level) is commonly seen in RMSF, as are low platelet counts and increased coagulation times, both of which can be manifestations of disseminated intravascular coagulation, an often fatal complication of this infection. Mortality with RMSF is ~1 to 3% with timely, appropriate antimicrobial therapy with doxycycline but may reach as high as 25% in untreated individuals. While the patient did have a 2-fold increase in <emphasis>Ehrlichia</emphasis> antibody titers, this result is within normal assay variability and does not meet the 4-fold rise in titer criteria for an ehrlichiosis diagnosis. The <emphasis>Ehrlichia</emphasis> antibody test results suggest that he has been exposed to the pathogen, but it is likely not the cause of his current infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  If not treated within the first few days of infection, RMSF can be rapidly progressive and fatal <link linkend="ch0043s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Initial symptoms may be mild and may not alert clinicians to suspect RMSF. People who develop more advanced disease may experience altered mental status, coma, cerebral edema, respiratory compromise, necrosis, multiorgan system damage, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In the United States, where RMSF epidemiology has been most closely scrutinized, the African American population experiences the greatest disease severity. The reasons for this appear to be 2-fold. First, in dark-skinned individuals, the rash, which is the key diagnostic feature of this infection, may be difficult to appreciate. This may delay the diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can have grave clinical consequences, most importantly, increased mortality. Second, African Americans often have poorer access to medical care than do many other groups of Americans, which may delay the diagnosis and thus treatment of this rapidly progressive disease.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis> is an obligate intracellular pathogen that during the early stages of the 20th century was considered a virus. This is a highly evolved organism with a comparatively small genome due in part to its lack of genes for glucose metabolism and for lipid and nucleic acid synthesis. Thus, this organism must obtain ATP from the host, as well as lipids, purines, and pyrimidines. The organism has a tropism for endothelial cells and can infect this cell type throughout the body. This <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis>tropism is due to the presence of a specific receptor on the endothelial cell surface called Ku 70. Once bound, the organism is taken into the cell by endocytosis and then lyses the endosome, allowing it to replicate in the cytoplasm. There it attaches host cell actin filaments that allow the organism to move through the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, where it can be taken up by adjacent cells by an endocytosis-like process. Over time (hours), this infectious process results in disruption of endothelial tight junctions, resulting in vascular leakage. Additionally, infection of the endothelial cells results in endothelial damage, which leads to platelet activation and consumption; and clotting due to thrombin formation, which can lead to hemorrhage and vascular occlusion.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Other methods described in the literature include the direct detection of <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis> in tissue biopsy specimens by using direct fluorescent-antibody assay or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) <link linkend="ch0043s0002bib06">(6)</link>. The direct fluorescent-antibody assay has the advantage of being very rapid and, in skilled hands, very specific. However, its sensitivity is dependent on the quality of the tissue biopsy. A negative test does not rule out this diagnosis. This test is available in only a very limited number of laboratories. Immunohistochemical techniques can also be used to detect this organism in fixed tissues.</para>
        <para>NAAT has also been applied to the detection of <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis>, but it is not yet widely available. NAAT is more sensitive in biopsies of the skin rash than it is from samples of blood. This is not surprising, since the organism is an obligate intracellular pathogen that specifically infects endothelial cells, a cell type likely to be found in biopsy material but not in blood. The organism can also be isolated from blood by inoculation of guinea pigs, embryonated eggs, or tissue culture using the shell vial technique. However, cultivation of this organism is extremely dangerous and is attempted only in a few highly specialized laboratories.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for RMSF and all other rickettsial diseases, and treatment should be started immediately. The CDC reports that due to the increased risk of death without treatment, the initiation of doxycycline should never be withheld while waiting for diagnostic test results <link linkend="ch0043s0002bib04">(4)</link>. In most patients, the fever will subside within 24 to 48 hours of receiving doxycycline. Patients with severe rickettsial disease should be hospitalized and managed with fluid management and close attention to electrolyte balance.</para>
