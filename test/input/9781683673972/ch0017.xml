      <sect1 id="ch0017s0004"><title>CASE 14</title><para>The patient was a 59-year-old female presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a few days of worsening shortness of breath and hypoxia. Her past medical history was significant for bilateral lung transplant ~7 years prior (cytomegalovirus donor-positive/recipient-negative), currently with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and recent acute antibody-mediated rejection treated with methylprednisolone (40 mg twice daily), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and rituximab. Over the previous couple of days, she noted oxygen saturations in the 60s and 70s, requiring a 5-liter/minute nasal cannula even at rest (at baseline only needing 2 liters/minute with exertion). She also described multiple episodes of hemoptysis. Upon arrival in the ED, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 171/113 mm Hg; heart rate, 83 beats/minute; temperature, 98.8°F; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/minute; and SpO<subscript>2</subscript>, 71% on room air. Chest computed tomography scan showed new bilateral ground-glass opacities and several nodular and centrally cavitary consolidations in the upper lobes.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The infectious differential for ground-glass opacities (GGOs) includes viral pneumonia, including that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Bacterial causes include <emphasis>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</emphasis> and oral microbiota, including anaerobic bacteria, introduced through aspiration <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib02">(2)</link>. In immunocompromised patients, particularly those living with advanced HIV disease with low CD4 counts, <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis> commonly appears as GGOs. Nodular and cavitary lesions can be seen in a variety of infections <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib03">(3)</link>. <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> is a classic cause of cavitating lesions, but other mycobacteria, including <emphasis>Mycobacterium avium</emphasis> complex, can cause cavitating lesions similar in appearance to those of <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis>. Pyogenic bacteria, including <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>, <emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis>, <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, can appear as a nodular pneumonia and cavitary lesions in necrotizing pneumonia. Several fungal infections can appear as nodular or cavitary lesions in the lungs. These include endemic mycoses such as <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> spp. and <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp. In immunocompromised patients, including transplant patients, those with hematologic malignancies, and other neutropenic patients, <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp. and the <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis> family of molds present with this radiographic appearance. Nodules with surrounding edema (GGO) are classically referred to as the “halo sign,” and when cavitating, the “air crescent sign.”</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Numerous guidelines exist for the diagnosis of IFI, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis, the ECMM practice guidelines for mucormycosis, and the American Thoracic Society practice guidelines for microbiological testing for fungal infections (<link linkend="ch0017s0002bib04">4</link>–<link linkend="ch0017s0002bib07">7</link>). All guidelines recommend obtaining tissue, fluid, or other appropriate specimen (e. g., bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] fluid) from the presumed site of infection for culture and histopathology/cytology. Media used to culture fungi may vary by specimen source, but commonly used media include brain heart infusion agar, a universal enriched agar for the growth of most molds; Mycosel or mycobiotic agar, a selective agar containing cycloheximide and chloramphenicol to inhibit the growth of bacteria and saprophytic fungi from nonsterile sources; and inhibitory mold agar, a selective agar containing chloramphenicol that can support the growth of cycloheximide-sensitive fungi including <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> and <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib08">(8)</link>. While collection can be invasive, no other method can as definitively prove invasive infection. Additionally, culture can provide an isolate for detailed identification and subsequent susceptibility testing, should it be warranted. Fungal antigen testing, including the <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>GM test and BDG assay, can be used as noninvasive diagnostics from blood or directly from some fluids (e. g., BAL fluid, cerebrospinal fluid). The benefits of fungal antigen testing, in addition to being noninvasive, include an earlier time to positive for IFI than other methods. However, performance varies among patient populations and severity of infection. Additionally, there are many sources of cross-reactivity that can cause a false-positive GM or BDG. These limitations are acknowledged in the guidelines, where fungal antigen testing is only recommended in cases with a high index of suspicion and in patient populations where assay performance has demonstrated the greatest utility (e. g., stem cell transplant recipients). Notable fungi that do not contain BDG and therefore infections will give a negative BDG result include <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis>, <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis>. Molecular methods for fungal nucleic acid detection directly from invasively collected samples or as a screening diagnostic from blood, similar to the antigen testing approach, are newer applications with rapidly evolving clinical utility and performance data. This flux is reflected in the guidelines for diagnosis, with stronger recommendations in more recently updated documents or from societies with more experience with these methods in practice. Similar to antigen testing, molecular methods are most consistently recommended for use in patients with a high likelihood of IFI or when more traditional diagnostics have failed (e. g., when there is evidence of IFI on histopathology, but cultures are negative, molecular testing may be useful in identifying the mold). It should be noted that positive molecular results may not exclusively indicate invasive infection and could be a result of colonization, lowering the positive predictive value of the test. This may be particularly true for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from BAL fluid where detection may indicate carriage of these ubiquitous environmental organisms.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The list of possible cross-reactive substances that could cause a false-positive GM or BDG is long. Some antibiotics and foods, as well as Plasma-Lyte, have been shown to be causes of false positives for GM <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Patients with mucosal barrier issues that allow translocation of these compounds into the bloodstream may be at higher risk for false positives. Additionally, other molds contain galactomannan and therefore can produce a positive result and reduce specificity for <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>. False-positive BDG can occur with compounds that contain glucans, including cellulose membranes used in hemodialysis, gauze, filters, and numerous intravenous fluid formulations including antibiotics <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib09">(9)</link>. As these assays are recommended for use in the most clinically ill and immunocompromised patients, it is easy to understand that the risk of a false positive may be high. A single positive result should be evaluated in the context of the patient and other available diagnostic results. Serial positive results can increase the specificity of fungal antigen testing <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Macroscopically the mold is velvety in texture <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib11">(11)</link>. The thallus (surface) is dark green with a white border. Microscopic features include septate hyphae and conidiophores. The conidiophores terminate in a vesicle with uniseriate phialides on the upper two-thirds with short chains of round conidia. This appearance is consistent with an <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> vesicle, specifically that of <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> complex.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Patients with immunosuppressive conditions, such as stem cell transplant, solid organ transplant, or hematologic malignancy, are at increased risk for invasive aspergillosis (IA) <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib12">(12)</link>. High dose and/or long duration of corticosteroids increases the risk of IA <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Severe respiratory infection can lead to IA, as was seen with increased rates of IA in patients with severe COVID-19. This phenomenon of IA secondary to severe COVID-19 was dubbed COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, or CAPA <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib14">(14)</link>. The risk of IA with use of monoclonal antibody therapy, such as rituximab in this patient’s case, is unclear <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib15">(15)</link>. There is at least concern of increased risk for IA while on these immunosuppressive therapies, but more data are needed to assess the magnitude of risk <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib16">(16)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Voriconazole is the IDSA-recommended therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Alternative regimens include liposomal amphotericin B or isavuconazole. For patients with severe disease, combination therapy with voriconazole and an echinocandin is an option. Also to be considered is the reduction or elimination of immunosuppressive therapies.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7</emphasis>.  While trending BDG result over time as a response to therapy is imperfect, some studies have shown that downward trends in BDG concentrations have been correlated with improved prognosis <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib17">(17)</link>. Antifungal resistance was raised as a concern given evolving infection and a history of posaconazole therapy (1 year duration) a few years prior after isolation of <emphasis>Rhizopus</emphasis> species from BAL fluid.</para>
        <para>Globally, antifungal resistance in <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> is a major threat, making the list of World Health Organization fungal priority pathogens <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Azole resistance rates as high as ~20% have been documented in some areas of the world, threatening the most common and effective treatment strategy <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib19">(19)</link>. In the United States, resistance rates have remained low, ~1%, for azole-naïve patients. However, in patient populations that receive prolonged azole therapy or prophylaxis (e. g., stem cell transplant patients), resistance rates of up to 7% have been observed<link linkend="ch0017s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Mechanisms of azole resistance in <emphasis>A. fumigatus</emphasis> often result from alterations in <emphasis>cyp 51A</emphasis>, a lanosterol 14α-demethylase integral to the ergoterol synthesis pathway <link linkend="ch0017s0002bib20">(20)</link>. These alterations can be point mutations within the gene or tandem repeats found in the promoter region.</para>
