The patient presented to the emergency department with altered consciousness, confusion, and agitation. A family member noted that the patient had nausea and vomiting before arrival. No seizure activity or fevers were noted.</para>
      <para>His vital signs were normal on physical examination, but he was confused and agitated, making a neurologic examination impossible. The chest was clear to auscultation. He was without rashes. He did have abdominal distension with ascites. Laboratory tests were significant for a peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count of 27,800 cells/μl with 95% neutrophils. The patient was anemic and had a 483 mg/dl blood glucose level. Because of his high WBC count and altered mental status, a lumbar puncture was performed, which revealed an opaque cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing 5,600 red blood cells (RBCs)/μl and 31,400 WBCs/μl with 95% neutrophils and 5% monocytes. The patient’s CSF protein was 1,422 mg/dl, and CSF glucose was 124 mg/dl.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>The patient’s altered mental status and history of alcohol use disorder could indicate alcohol withdrawal, especially since his vital signs were normal. However, his history of liver cirrhosis, alcohol use disorder, and diabetes put the patient at increased risk for infection. Given his presentation of altered mental status, confusion, and agitation, some central nervous system infections should be considered. His elevated peripheral WBC count further supports the idea of an infection. Given his presentation, a lumbar puncture was obtained and was grossly abnormal. In a patient with altered mental status, elevated WBC count, and abnormal CSF cell count, glucose, and protein, the patient likely has a central nervous system infection (i. e., meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis). Encephalitis is most commonly caused by viruses, with herpes simplex virus and arboviruses being the most common, while enteroviruses are more likely to cause meningitis. The CSF findings in patients with viral encephalitis or meningitis would be a few hundred WBCs with a predominance of lymphocytes, normal glucose (approximately two-thirds the level in peripheral blood), and a slightly elevated or normal protein. The patient’s laboratory findings were quite different from this. Patients with bacterial meningitis have a WBC count of &gt;1,000 cells/μl, a neutrophil predominance, glucose considerably less than two-thirds of the peripheral blood glucose level, and an elevated protein. This patient had a highly inflammatory CSF with &gt;30,000 WBCs, so many cells that the patient’s CSF was opaque, suggesting a bacterial etiology. The possible organisms in a 45-year-old patient with bacterial meningitis are very limited. In adults,<emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis globally <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib01">(1)</link>. <emphasis>Neisseria meningitidis</emphasis>, the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis, should also be considered. <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis>is problematic because certain serogroups (e. g., A, B, C, Y) are associated with epidemic spread.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  In this case, the ratio of WBCs to RBCs was ~6 WBCs for each RBC, indicating that the CSF was inflammatory. Patients with inflamed meninges due to bacterial infection have elevated protein in the CSF. The normal CSF protein value is 15 to 45 mg/dl; this patient’s CSF protein was ~1,400 mg/dl higher than that. Normal CSF glucose ranges from 50 to 75 mg/dl, and the patient had a CSF glucose level of 124. While this may seem like an elevated value, it is important to remember that the normal value for CSF glucose is two-thirds that of the peripheral blood glucose. Since this patient’s peripheral glucose was 483 mg/dl, a “normal” CSF glucose for him would be roughly 300 to 330 mg/dl. His actual CSF glucose was 124 mg/dl, or one-quarter of his peripheral level, meaning he had reduced CSF glucose. In cases of bacterial meningitis, glucose levels in the CSF are decreased due to consumption by WBCs and bacteria, as well as impaired glucose transport <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The Gram stain shows Gram-positive diplococci in chains. Gram-positive diplococci, particularly if a capsule is visualized, are suggestive of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. However, other Gram-positive organisms that may make chains or resemble elongated cocci should be considered. <emphasis>Listeria monocytogenes</emphasis> is a Gram-positive coccobacillus and might appear like the organism on this Gram stain <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Given that <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> infection is most often seen in individuals who are pregnant or significantly immunocompromised, it is unlikely that this patient had <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> meningitis. However, two other organisms would also need to be considered. Group B <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> (<emphasis>Streptococcus agalactiae</emphasis>), while more often a cause of meningitis in neonates, can also cause meningitis in diabetic patients <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Group A <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis> (<emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis>) may also cause meningitis but is less common. Finally, for completeness, <emphasis>Streptococcus suis</emphasis> has been associated with adults with meningitis <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib05">(5)</link>. This patient did not appear to be at risk for infection with this organism, as it is seen primarily in people in close contact with hogs, and while it is one of the most common causes of bacterial meningitis in southeast Asia, it is rare in the United States <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Based on the clinical findings of bacterial meningitis, the Gram stain (<link linkend="ch0045s0004fg01">Fig. 42.1</link>), and the alpha-hemolytic organism seen in culture, this patient had <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> meningitis. The organism’s identity was confirmed by inhibition of growth around an optochin disk (ethylhydrocupreine hydrochloride, a chemical to which <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> is susceptible) (<link linkend="ch0045s0004fg02">Fig. 42.2</link>). Culture is still considered the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of invasive <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> disease, but it is important to note that the sensitivity of the test decreases significantly if the patient was pretreated with antibiotics <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib07">(7)</link>. However, the use of classic identification techniques on organisms grown from culture (e. g., bile solubility and optochin disk) continue to be affordable and reliable methods for identification. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is another common method of organism identification used in the laboratory. In recent years, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) directly on CSF have been demonstrated to have good performance, with high sensitivity and specificity overall. There are two FDA-cleared molecular meningitis/encephalitis multiplex panels that detect a number of bacteria, viruses, and yeast from CSF (<link linkend="ch0045s0002bib08">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib09">9</link>). While NAAT performs better than culture on specimens from patients that have been pretreated, false-positive results are more common, and this should be taken into account when interpreting results alongside the patient’s clinical picture <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib10">(10)</link>. In particular, the highest number of false-positive results on a multiplex NAAT for meningitis has been for <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>, likely as a result of contamination during collection or testing procedures <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib11">(11)</link>.</para>
        <para>Another method of identifying <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection is the urinary antigen test. This test detects <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> antigens that are shed and excreted in the urine from a patient who has an infection with <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. However, this test is not appropriate for all specimen types, and is only recommended for use in patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib11">(12)</link>. Due to its high specificity when used in the appropriate patient population, the urinary antigen test is useful in ruling in cases of pneumonia caused by <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib13">(13)</link>. There is a high risk of false-positive results in patients with a CAP episode within the previous 3 months, patients with high levels of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> colonization, or patients who have recently been vaccinated against <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> is part of the microbiota of the nasopharynx, and its ability to act as an opportunistic pathogen is complex and dependent on various factors associated with host response and organism strain <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib15">(15)</link>. There are multiple virulence factors that play a role in the invasive disease process, but capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are the most important defense against the host’s immune system. The CPS virulence factor is a major surface antigen of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>, and there are more than 98 distinct serotypes of CPS. Approximately 23 serotypes are responsible for 80 to 90% of invasive pneumococcal disease <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib16">(16)</link>.</para>
        <para>Capsules act in two ways to evade innate and adaptive immunity. First, they inhibit phagocytosis by preventing the interaction of fragments of immunoglobulin G (IgG) bound to receptors on phagocytic cells. Second, the surface charge of these encapsulated bacteria is such that they are not entrapped in mucus and, thus, are not cleared efficiently by ciliary action. A second important virulence factor is pneumolysin. Pneumolysin is released from the bacteria during lysis. It has at least three different roles in pathogenesis. It can bind to the Fc portion of IgG and activate complement, depleting it from the bloodstream; it inhibits ciliary beating, further impairing ciliary clearance; and it binds and damages type 2 pneumocytes, facilitating entry of the organism into the bloodstream in the alveolar space.</para>
        <para>If the organism is not cleared by the spleen and liver (key organs in the clearance of bacteria from the bloodstream), it can be carried to the central nervous system, where it can adhere to endothelial cells and be translocated across the blood-brain barrier. Once in the central nervous system, the organisms release various bacterial products, such as cell wall lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan, which elicit a strong cytokine-mediated inflammatory response responsible for much of the tissue damage characteristic of this infection. This is a rare event in normally healthy individuals because innate and adaptive immunity will kill the organism long before it reaches the meninges.</para>
        <para>Three factors are important in allowing this to occur and put this patient at increased risk for invasive disease with pneumococci: alcohol use disorder, diabetes, and liver cirrhosis. All three adversely affect innate immunity. The strongest association of these three risk factors with invasive pneumococcal infection is alcohol use disorder<link linkend="ch0045s0002bib17">(17)</link>. There are at least four factors that explain this association. First, alcohol causes a decreased cough reflex, allowing this common upper airway microbiota member access to the bronchial and alveolar spaces. <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> is a component of the nasopharyngeal microbiota of ~20 to 40% of adults and is the most virulent of the commonly found members of that bacterial community. Alcohol also adversely affects ciliary clearance by decreasing beat frequency. When organisms get to the alveolar space, they are more likely to survive because there is an impairment in neutrophil recruitment and function. Additionally, the antimicrobial proteins lysozyme and lactoferrin have been shown to have impaired the killing of pneumococci in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of alcoholic patients.</para>
        <para>The problem of alcohol use disorder was further magnified by the presence of diabetes in this patient. In high-glucose environments, neutrophil function is impaired due to suppressing ATP generation. This results in impaired neutrophil adherence, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing. Finally, patients with liver cirrhosis have decreased complement levels because hepatic cells are a key source of complement in the body. Because complement plays a key proinflammatory role in response to infection, lowering complement levels results in poorer opsonophagocytic response and clearance of this organism.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>Gradient diffusion (e. g., E-test) uses the same principle of disk diffusion, which is the establishment of an antimicrobial concentration gradient within agar medium<link linkend="ch0045s0002bib18">(18)</link>. This method can be used for various organisms and may be particularly useful for fastidious organisms that do not grow well in automated AST systems. A suspension containing the patient’s pneumococcal isolate is applied to the surface of a Mueller-Hinton agar plate supplemented with 5% sheep blood. After the bacterial lawn dries, test strips containing the antimicrobials of interest, in this case penicillin G and ceftriaxone, are applied to the plate. These two drugs were tested because they are commonly used to treat pneumococcal meningitis and are listed as two of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) tier 1 <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> drugs that are appropriate for routine, primary testing and reporting <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib19">(19)</link>. A gradient of increasing concentration of antimicrobial is bound to each strip. When the strip comes in contact with the agar surface, antibiotic is released and “diffuses” into the agar. The strip is marked with different drug concentrations. Where the organism’s growth meets the strip determines the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the organism. The zone of growth inhibition observed is elliptical; thus, the name “E-test.”</para>
        <para>For this patient’s organism, the penicillin G MIC was 0.064 μg/ml and the ceftriaxone MIC was 0.032 μg/ml. Because the organism was causing a central nervous system infection, the criteria for determining whether it is resistant to these antimicrobials differ from if it was causing pneumonia or non-meningitis systemic infection (see<ulink url="ch0011.xml#ch0011">case 8</ulink>). Antimicrobials cross the blood-brain barrier at only a fraction of the level they will be found in the bloodstream. As a result, the MIC indicating resistance is much less when testing <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> isolates from the CSF; for penicillin G a MIC of ≥0.12 μg/ml, and for ceftriaxone a MIC of ≥2 μg/ml are considered resistant. As seen from the results, the patient’s isolate was susceptible to both.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Clinical guidelines for the management of bacterial meningitis recommend empiric therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone when the Gram stain of CSF shows Gram-positive organisms that resemble <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib20">(20)</link>. Because it is difficult to fully rule out <emphasis>L. monocytogenes</emphasis> from the primary Gram stain, and it is clinically resistant to ceftriaxone, adding vancomycin was appropriate as initial empiric therapy. Vancomycin is also included empirically to treat drug-resistant <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted after organism identification and susceptibility testing are obtained. In this case, it would have been appropriate to stop the use of vancomycin since the identification of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> was confirmed and the organism was susceptible to less toxic antimicrobials.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Inappropriate and excess antibiotic use is one of the most significant factors contributing to antimicrobial resistance globally. The treatment of viral respiratory infections with antibiotics has been a significant driver of resistance in <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. While antimicrobial use has direct effects on targeted pathogens, it also affects commensal microbiota such as other species of streptococci living in the upper airways. Because <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> commonly resides as a commensal oropharyngeal organism, sharing of genetic information with other resident microbiota is possible <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib21">(21)</link>. When penicillin-resistant strains of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> emerged, elegant molecular genetics studies determined that the resistance genes for penicillin originally emerged in the oral commensal streptococci and were spread to <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> via transformation and recombination. Pneumococcal strains that are resistant to all commonly used oral antimicrobials are frequently seen in children, especially in those who attend group child care, a setting in which spread and high carriage rates of drug-resistant pneumococci are common <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib22">(22)</link>. Multidrug-resistant <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> has been identified as a serious threat by the CDC in the United States. Furthermore, a global study published in 2022 cited drug-resistant <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> as one of the six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib23">(23)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have significantly reduced the burden of death from invasive <emphasis>S. pneumoniae </emphasis>infections <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib24">(24)</link>. Polysaccharide vaccines derived from the <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> capsule were developed throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In 1983, a vaccine containing 23 capsular polysaccharides was licensed and is still in use today. Although this vaccine had a significant impact on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults, the efficacy in children &lt;2 years old was poor. To address this challenge, scientists created a vaccine that combines <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> capsular polysaccharides with inactivated diphtheria toxin to induce a significant immune response. After several iterations, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines covering 15 (PCV15) and 20 (PCV20) serotypes came to market. Currently, the CDC recommends giving PCV15 or PCV20 to infants as a series of four doses administered at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 through 15 months <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib25">(25)</link>. In adults 65 years or older, the CDC recommends the administration of PCV15 or PCV20 for all those who never received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination status is unknown.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Patients with sickle cell anemia are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease due to functional asplenia. The spleen is the major filtering organ that eliminates <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> and other encapsulated organisms from the bloodstream. Sickled red cells cause vaso-occlusive infarction in the spleen, which, over time, results in splenic atrophy and a decreased ability to clear encapsulated bacteria, especially pneumococci. Patients &lt;3 years of age with sickle cell anemia are given prophylactic antimicrobials, typically penicillin and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine <link linkend="ch0045s0002bib26">(26)</link>. For children and adults with underlying health conditions, vaccine dosing and type (e. g., PCV15, PCV20, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23) will depend on whether they have been vaccinated before and if so, what type of pneumococcal vaccine they received<link linkend="ch0045s0002bib25">(25)</link>.</para>
