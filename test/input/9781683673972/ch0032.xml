      <sect1 id="ch0032s0004"><title>CASE 29</title><para>The patient was a 46-year-old man living in a mid-Atlantic state with a history of alcohol abuse who presented during August to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain, fever, chills, and leg cramping. On physical examination, he had a temperature of 37.1°C, blood pressure of 93/34 mm Hg, heart rate of 125 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 30 respirations per minute, and O<subscript>2</subscript> saturation of 100% on room air.

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The patient’s respiratory rate of 30 respirations/minute and systolic blood pressure of 93 mm Hg met the definition of sepsis as defined by quick Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment, or qSOFA. Over the past decade, there has been considerable debate in intensive care literature on how to define sepsis <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib01">(1)</link>. An international working group developed a consensus definition of sepsis based on easily measured criteria of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib02">(2)</link>. This definition is based on an individual patient meeting two or more of three criteria: high respiratory rate (&gt;22 respirations/minute), low systolic blood pressure (&lt;100 mm Hg), and altered mental status. SOFA is widely used to define sepsis, but requires laboratory testing. The advantage of qSOFA is that it is easily measured without laboratory testing.</para>
        <para>Although the patient’s mental status was not documented in his history, he still met the definition of sepsis because of his high respiratory rate and decreased systolic blood pressure.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The results of his laboratory testing are consistent with septic shock. The poor perfusion of organs and tissues resulting from low arterial blood pressure results in severe circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that can result in extensive tissue damage. Multiorgan failure is a cardinal finding in septic shock. One of the best markers of septic shock is an elevated blood lactate, reflecting metabolic dysfunction. This patient’s serum lactate was highly elevated. Patients with kidney dysfunction have an elevated creatinine level, which is also seen in this patient. Elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes are seen with liver dysfunction secondary to septic shock, although in this patient, these findings may have been due to liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse seen by imaging. The high creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels are associated with generalized tissue damage, while the low platelet count is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is characterized by the systemic activation of the coagulation cascade in an unregulated manner. This results in the intravascular deposition of fibrin and, as a result, occlusive thrombi in the microvasculature and the consumption of coagulation factors and platelets. The occlusive thrombi may result in ischemic events that impair the perfusion of vital organs. The consumption and subsequent depletion of clotting factors and platelets, or “consumptive coagulopathy,” often result in bleeding. This may be noted in the skin as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymoses. DIC is a severe manifestation of septic shock, is life-threatening, and is associated with a high mortality.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The patient’s physical findings, vital signs, and laboratory findings of multiorgan failure are consistent with septic shock. Fluid resuscitation to improve blood pressure and organ perfusion is essential <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib03">(3)</link>. In septic patients with cirrhosis, piperacillin-tazobactam is recommended for antibiotic treatment <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib04">(4)</link>. The use of ceftriaxone and doxycycline as empiric therapy is somewhat surprising. This choice may have been made because the clinician suspected the patient had <emphasis>Vibrio vulnificus</emphasis> septicemia. This combination is recommended for the treatment of this infection <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Animal data and some clinical data suggest that doxycycline is the more effective agent of the two <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Adults with sepsis typically have low-grade bacteremia, meaning they have a low number of bacteria per milliliter of blood cultured. In many cases, especially in Gram-negative bacteremia &lt;1 organism/ml of blood will be present in the bloodstream <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib05">(5)</link>. If the patient is treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials or is given a large bolus of fluid prior to blood cultures being obtained, the organism may either be killed or diluted out by the fluid. Therefore, blood cultures should always be obtained prior to the beginning of therapy, especially antimicrobial therapy.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  The Gram stain shows Gram-negative bacilli with some of the organisms being curved. It is not consistent with common <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>species (e. g.,<emphasis>E. coli, Klebsiella</emphasis> spp.), which tend to be plumper in appearance. The Gram stain is consistent with <emphasis>Vibrio</emphasis> and <emphasis>Aeromonas</emphasis>. <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> should also be considered. Because the patient was failing, the clinician broadened therapy to improve <emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis> coverage. The reality is that there are no clinical trial data comparing different therapies for <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> because these infections, although increasing, are quite rare. All of the agents this patient received are active <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> against the organism that infected him, but mortality in patients with cirrhosis who develop sepsis is quite high. The evidence base for antimicrobial therapy for <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> is very limited.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>Two primary Gram-negative organisms should be considered when the oxidase reaction is positive, is growing on Mac Conkey agar, and a patient has septicemia:<emphasis>Aeromonas hydrophila</emphasis> and <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis>. Close examination of <link linkend="ch0032s0004fg02">Fig. 29.2</link> reveals that the organism is growing poorly and only in the area where inoculum from the blood culture was placed. This suggests that some nutrient was present in the inoculum that the organism needed for growth. <emphasis>A. hydrophila</emphasis>grows well on Mac Conkey agar and would have grown in all areas of the plate. However,<emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> is a halophile, meaning an organism that prefers to grow in high salt levels. The inoculum from the blood culture bottle contains blood and provides additional salt to support the growth of <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis>, but sufficient salt to support growth will only be found in the area where the plate was initially inoculated. This observation makes it more likely that the organism was <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis>, and that information was communicated to the clinical team. Subsequently, this identification was confirmed by the laboratory.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  In this case, we can only speculate because the patient lived alone and was in extremis when he arrived at the hospital. He was admitted in August, when the highest number of cases of <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> occur <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib06">(6)</link>. During the summer months, <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> counts in seawater increase because the organism only replicates above 13°C. These temperatures are found in oyster-raising areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, where 60 to 70% of the oysters are harvested in the United States. Oysters are filter feeders that can concentrate environmental microorganisms such as <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> to high numbers in their flesh. The assumption in this case is that the patient consumed raw oysters contaminated with high numbers of <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> prior to becoming ill. More than 95% of disseminated <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> infections are associated with consuming raw oysters. This organism is responsible for almost all seafood-associated deaths in the United States <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib06">(6)</link>. It has the highest mortality of any food-borne infection. People may also become infected through introduction of the bacteria into wounds during swimming, fishing, or handling seafood. This type of infection may rapidly progress to necrotizing fasciitis resulting in amputation or death.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Individuals with viral hepatitis or alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis who develop <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> septicemia have a mortality rate of 55%, while those without liver disease have a lower mortality rate of 15% <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib07">(7)</link>. The liver plays an important role in innate immunity in both the gut and systemically. The liver synthesizes complement components. Complement is essential for innate immunity. In individuals with liver cirrhosis, complement levels are depressed. This depression adversely affects chemotaxis and opsonic phagocytosis of encapsulated organisms such as <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis>. Cirrhotic individuals have higher levels of iron in the bloodstream, an essential nutrient for the growth and virulence of this organism <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib07">(7)</link>. The likely manner in which this patient became infected was ingestion of <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> in contaminated raw or undercooked seafood. It survived passage through the stomach in part because individuals with liver cirrhosis have reduced stomach acidity. Alteration in the microbiota in individuals with cirrhosis is associated with reduced production of protective short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile salts, and tryptophan metabolites, which are essential for local immunity. The organism produces a multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin, or MARTX, which is essential for translocation of the organism from the gut to the bloodstream <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib04">(4)</link>. It is able to evade phagocytosis during translocation because of reduced chemotaxis and opsonic phagocytosis in the lamina propria due to reduced complement levels in this tissue <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Second, the activity of Kupffer cells, fixed macrophages in the liver, to filter bacteria from the bloodstream is diminished in individuals with cirrhosis, allowing the organism to continue to disseminate unabated. Importantly, <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> produces capsular polysaccharide, which is essential in the organism’s ability to evade the host’s immune response. A variety of other virulence factors, including endotoxin and several proteases, are responsible for the tissue destruction and disseminated intravascular coagulation that was observed in this patient <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  One Health is the interdisciplinary study of the interaction of humans, animals, plants, and the environment on human health outcomes <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib09">(9)</link>. One area of interest is how alteration of the environment due to global warming impacts human health. <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> is a halophilic, aquatic organism that grows best when sea and estuary water temperatures are above 13°C. <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> in the environment and seafood can be classified into virulent and environmental strains <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Environmental strains lack key virulence factors and do not cause human disease. </para>
        <para>Environmental strains grow at a variety of salinities, while virulent ones are primarily detected in water with higher salinities<link linkend="ch0032s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Additionally, environmental strains predominate in estuary water and shellfish. Sea and estuary water temperatures may rise above 30°C during summer, at which these organisms will more rapidly reproduce. During these warm weather months, <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> human infections increase due to direct (wound infections) or indirect (systemic infection) exposure to these more highly contaminated salt or brackish waters <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib06">(6)</link>. With the warming of oceans and estuaries, there is concern that the number of cases of <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> will increase.</para>
        <para>Another aspect of global warming impacting One Health is increasing numbers of tropical storms<link linkend="ch0032s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Tropical storms decrease salinity and increase organic nutrients from water runoff, especially animal fecal waste in watersheds with high numbers of concentrated animal feeding operations or intensive fertilizer use. This increases <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> numbers in estuaries due to increasing organic nutrients from agricultural runoff. Paradoxically, it also causes decreased salinity, favoring the growth of environmental (nonvirulent) <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> strains. How increasing numbers of tropical storms impact the epidemiology of <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> human infection requires further study. However, in fall 2023, the CDC issued a health advisory that exposure to warming coastal waters, especially in Gulf Coast states, could lead to increasing numbers of <emphasis>V. vulnificus</emphasis> infections, particularly those of skin and soft tissues <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Necrotizing fasciitis is of particular concern.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Vibrio cholerae</emphasis> causes the disease cholera <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib13">(13)</link>. It is an aquatic organism spread by ingesting contaminated water or food or from person to person. Cholera is a disease characterized by a voluminous, watery diarrhea in which the infected individual can lose many liters of fluid in a day. If this fluid is not replaced, it can result in multiorgan failure and death. Cholera has one of the best-understood pathophysiologies of any infectious disease.</para>
        <para>Cholera toxin is an A+B toxin produced by <emphasis>V. cholerae</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib13">(13)</link>. The B subunits bind to specific receptors on intestinal cells, the GM1 gangliosides. The B subunit produces a pore-like structure through which the A subunit enters intestinal cells, where it activates adenylate cyclase, producing increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Increases in cAMP result in the blockage of Na<superscript>+</superscript> and Cl<superscript>–</superscript> uptake in the intestinal epithelium and promote the secretion of Cl<superscript>–</superscript> and water from crypt cells, resulting in the characteristic watery diarrhea. The recognition that glucose could reverse the blockage of Na<superscript>+</superscript> and water uptake by microvilli induced by cholera toxin led to the development of a novel, simple oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in which table salt (NaCl), table salt supplement (KCl), baking soda (NaHCO<subscript>3</subscript>), glucose, and water are mixed together and consumed by the patient with diarrhea. When initially used, ORT reduced cholera mortality from 30 to 3%. Today, the World Health Organization’s target for the mortality rate in cholera outbreaks is &lt;1%.</para>
        <para>Cholera is a disease of poverty<link linkend="ch0032s0002bib13">(13)</link>. As such, it is rare in high-income countries with clean water, access to sanitary facilities, and good personal hygiene (WASH). Since 2010, there have been millions of cholera cases in displaced populations. Four of the largest cholera outbreaks were in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake and again in 2022, in Yemen and South Sudan during civil wars, and in Bangladesh in individuals of a religious minority expelled from Myanmar (<link linkend="ch0032s0002bib14">14</link>–<link linkend="ch0032s0002bib17">17</link>). In Haiti, Yemen, and South Sudan, damage or destruction of water and human waste disposal infrastructure was central to the cholera outbreaks. A 2022–2023 outbreak in Haiti was a result of political unrest in the capital city, Port-au-Prince, centered on the impoverished Citi Soleil neighborhood, home to 200,000 to 400,000 people. A tragic result of the Syrian civil war were cholera outbreaks in Syrian refugee camps <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib18">(18)</link>. In Bangladesh, the refugee camp was located in a region with inadequate water supplies and sanitary facilities that were easily flooded during rainy seasons.</para>
        <para>Displaced populations have limited access to WASH<link linkend="ch0032s0002bib17">(17)</link>. Outbreaks in these populations are particularly acute during rainy seasons when open defecation due to inadequate sanitary facilities in refugee camps can result in contamination of drinking water, food, and the living environment and contribute to the spread of the disease <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Further complicating this situation are high rates of malnutrition in displaced persons, especially in children, the population most likely to be infected, making them more susceptible to disease. Control of these outbreaks depends on establishing clean water supplies, safe disposal of human waste, and improved hand hygiene, particularly in those who prepare food and feed infants and young children <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Unfortunately, this is not always possible because of a lack of supplies and public health workers to provide the needed infrastructure and education. Although cholera in displaced persons is a difficult problem, there are some hopeful signs. In the Yemen outbreak that affected more than 1.1 million people, the mortality rate was 0.22% in large part due to the widespread use of ORT <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib15">(15)</link>. In South Sudan, the distribution of more than 2 million doses of oral cholera vaccine blunted the outbreaks there <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Unfortunately by 2023, the global supply of the vaccine was waning, making it unclear if there would be sufficient supplies to control future outbreaks <link linkend="ch0032s0002bib18">(18)</link>.</para>

Immune dysfunction due to decreased complement levels and poor activity of Kupffer cells, which filter blood in the liver, further increases the risk of mortality in this population.</para>

            <para><emphasis>V. cholerae</emphasis> is the most important human pathogen in the <emphasis>Vibrio</emphasis> genus. It causes cholera, a fulminant diarrheal disease. It is particularly dangerous in children less than 5 years old, with a mortality rate as high as 30% if not treated. Oral rehydration therapy is a cheap and easily administered treatment. It has reduced mortality of this infection to &lt;1%. Cholera is a disease of poverty. Cases are rare in high-income countries. Large outbreaks of cholera occur in situations where large populations are displaced by war or natural disaster and no longer have access to clean water, sanitary facilities, and good personal hygiene.</para>
