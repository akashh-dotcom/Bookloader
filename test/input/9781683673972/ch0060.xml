He was taking combination antiretroviral therapy and had a recent undetectable HIV viral load and a normal CD4 count of 631 cells/μl. Two months prior to his evaluation, he had anonymous unprotected sex with another man. At presentation, he complained of 2 weeks of mild temperature elevation, generalized achiness, and a diffuse rash.

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  A diffuse maculopapular rash, including the palms and soles, in an individual living with HIV and who had anonymous unprotected sex 2 months previously is consistent with the secondary stage of syphilis infection <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Low-grade fever and myalgias are also typically seen in this stage of infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The positive RPR test, when confirmed by a positive TPPA assay, is consistent with the diagnosis of syphilis.</para>
        <para><emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> is the etiologic agent of syphilis. Unlike other common agents of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), this organism cannot be cultured on an artificial medium or in tissue culture cells <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This inability to grow on artificial medium is because <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> lacks several genes that encode specific metabolic and biosynthetic processes that must be functioning for the organism to grow <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>, which requires it to scavenge amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids from the host <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib01">(1)</link>. As a result, laboratory detection has relied on direct microscopic examination using dark-field microscopy or serologic testing. Dark-field examination is comparatively insensitive and should not be used on oral lesions because the mouth harbors other spirochetes as a part of its normal microbiota <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib01">(2)</link>. Because syphilis is rare outside the setting of an STI clinic, most laboratorians lack the necessary experience to perform dark-field microscopy reliably.</para>
        <para>Syphilis serologic testing has traditionally been performed using a two-step algorithm<link linkend="ch0060s0002bib02">(2)</link>. In the initial step, a screening test is performed, followed by a confirmatory test if the screening test is positive. The desired characteristics of a screening test are that it is highly sensitive (detect all people with the disease state in question), rapid, easy to do and interpret, and inexpensive. While the RPR test has a high sensitivity in secondary syphilis, it misses approximately one-third of cases in primary syphilis and a similarly notable fraction of people with latent and tertiary syphilis, such as in many cases of neurosyphilis. Screening tests often are not highly specific (they may detect patients who do not have the disease state in question), so a test is needed to confirm the screening test results <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The confirmatory test is frequently more complex and more expensive. However, it is more specific than the screening test, which means that a positive result on the confirmatory test indicates the individual has the disease state for which they have been tested. In this case, the RPR test was performed as the screening test. RPR is a nontreponemal test, in that it detects the presence of an antibody that reacts with a purified beef heart extract (cardiolipin-lecithin and cholesterol particles) and not with a treponemal antigen. An RPR test may be positive due to a treponemal infection or one of many other causes, as it is not specific for syphilis <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib02">(2)</link>. As a result, there are many different infectious (e. g., leprosy, malaria, and infectious mononucleosis) and noninfectious (e. g., systemic lupus erythematosus) causes of a positive RPR result. Other treponemal diseases can cause a positive RPR test as well. It is uncommon for a patient from the United States with RPR titer as high as 1:256 to have a cause other than syphilis.</para>
        <para>The use of a confirmatory treponemal test, which may include either the TPPA assay or the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, can confirm the clinical diagnosis of syphilis in a patient with a positive nontreponemal screening test such as the RPR. These tests detect antibodies to treponemes. Though they are more specific than the RPR test, they are sometimes technically difficult to perform and would therefore be poor choices for screening tests.</para>
        <para>Once an individual has syphilis, the treponemal antibody tests remain positive even if the patient has been appropriately treated and the disease has been cured. In most cases of treated syphilis, the RPR titer progressively declines and ultimately becomes undetectable. As a result, a new positive RPR result in a patient who was treated for syphilis and had an undetectable (nonreactive) RPR following therapy is assumed to indicate reinfection. Of note, in some patients, particularly those with syphilis of long duration, the RPR titer remains positive at a low titer following therapy. As a result, a patient who has an increase from the low, positive titer should be evaluated under the assumption that the patient has been reinfected and, once again, has syphilis. Infection with <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> and appropriate treatment for syphilis do not prevent another syphilis infection in the future.</para>
        <para>The CDC, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, the United Kingdom Health Protection Agency, and the International Union against Sexually Transmitted Diseases all currently advocate a new testing algorithm for the detection of <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis>. In this algorithm, a <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis>-specific immunoassay is performed and, for positive specimens, an RPR test with titer is done as the confirmatory test (<link linkend="ch0060s0003fg03">Fig. 57.3</link>) <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib02">(2)</link>. This testing approach is called a reverse algorithm because the treponeme-specific test is initially performed as a screening test and the less specific nontreponemal test is performed as a confirmatory test <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib02">(2)</link>. This approach is more sensitive in early stages of primary syphilis and has excellent performance in untreated secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis. In addition to its sensitivity in early stages of primary syphilis, these groups advocate it because this approach can be automated, making it simple to screen large numbers of specimens accurately. The major drawback of the reverse syphilis algorithm is that patients who previously were infected with syphilis and were successfully treated will be positive in the screening or treponeme-specific part of this algorithm and negative in the confirmatory or nontreponeme part of the algorithm. When this occurs, a third test such as TPPA must be done. This too can be positive in a previously infected and treated patient, making management of such a patient complex.</para>
        <para>RPR titers can be used to determine the success of antimicrobial therapy<link linkend="ch0060s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Patients receiving appropriate therapy will either revert to negative or have at least a 4-fold decline in titer.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The hallmark primary stage of <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> infection results in a painless ulcer (or multiple ulcers) called a chancre <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The chancre occurs from 9 to 90 days (average of 21 days) following infection. In addition to being painless, the chancre will disappear even if the patient is untreated. This combination of a lack of pain and the fact that the chancre disappears is why many cases of syphilis are undetected early in the course of disease. In addition, the painless chancre may be unseen in women as it may not be anatomically apparent in a cursory examination of the external genitalia. An examination of material from the chancre under dark-field microscopy may demonstrate the presence of spirochetes (<emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis>).</para>
        <para>As pregnant women can be unknowingly infected with <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis>, an additional mode of infection can occur: transplacental transmission. A resurgence in congenital syphilis cases in the past decade makes screening for syphilis in all pregnant women essential for reversing this disturbing trend <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Following infection, primary syphilis, as evidenced by the presence of a chancre (see <phrase>answer to question 3</phrase>), occurs within an incubation period of 9 to 90 days. Dissemination of treponemes throughout the body can subsequently result in a diffuse symmetrical rash, often including the palms and soles, as well as generalized lymphadenopathy and abnormal liver function tests, and may result in “moth-eaten” alopecia <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Fever may occur, as may ocular involvement. This is secondary syphilis, which occurs 6 weeks to 6 months after exposure. The rash may be macular, maculopapular, pustular, papulosquamous, or follicular during secondary syphilis but will ultimately disappear. Lesions on mucosal surfaces (mouth, throat, and cervix) may occur. The rash contains many treponemes and the patient can infect others. There may be one or more relapses of secondary syphilis, including the generalized rash. Over time, the patient progresses to latent syphilis <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib01">(1)</link>. At this time, there are no signs or symptoms of syphilis. Only a fraction of patients subsequently progress to late syphilis. During late syphilis, there may be vascular destruction, typically obliterative endarteritis of the terminal arterioles and the small arteries, as well as destructive lesions (gummas) <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Neurosyphilis and cardiovascular syphilis may occur in late syphilis. Nontreponemal tests such as the RPR test are often negative in late syphilis.</para>
        <para>This patient had a generalized rash that was consistent with secondary syphilis. Alopecia, chronic fevers, and arthralgia and myalgia may also be seen in secondary syphilis, but these findings are not as specific as the skin rash that the patient presented with, which included involvement of the palms and soles. Men who have sex with men (MSM) have an increased risk for both HIV and syphilis. It is estimated that 25% of all syphilis cases in the United States occur in individuals coinfected with HIV and that people living with HIV are more than 50 times more likely to contract syphilis than the HIV-negative population<link linkend="ch0060s0002bib04">(4)</link>. The clinical presentation of syphilis in people living with HIV is similar to that in non-HIV-infected people, although people living with HIV who have low CD4 counts may have a more severe, rapidly progressive disease course. Additionally, people living with HIV with CD4 counts of &lt;350 cells/μl are much more likely to have neurosyphilis <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib04">(4)</link>. As a result, antimicrobial treatment regimens are prolonged in people living with advanced HIV. Given his low viral load and fairly high CD4 count, this patient would likely not require prolonged antimicrobial therapy.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>   Despite effective therapy and public health-focused prevention programs, rates of syphilis have increased dramatically over the last decade <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Most cases occur in MSM, although rates are also increasing in premenopausal women. The CDC reports that in 2021, 176,713 cases of syphilis (all stages and congenital syphilis) were reported, including 53,767 cases of primary and secondary syphilis <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Men are disproportionately affected by the disease, and MSM accounted for nearly half the male patients infected in 2021 <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Of the MSM infected with syphilis, nearly half are coinfected with HIV <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib04">(4)</link>. The drivers contributing to increased cases of syphilis are complex and numerous, and include behavioral factors such as increased drug use, changes in perception of susceptibility and severity of HIV infection due to the effectiveness of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and decreased condom use <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para>Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the rate of STIs across the United States<link linkend="ch0060s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Rates of primary and secondary syphilis increased 24% among reproductive-aged women from 2019 to 2020. This increase was directly associated with a 15% increase in cases of congenital syphilis since 2019. Between 2020 and 2021, rates of syphilis increased 52% among reproductive-aged women with a corresponding increase of 32% for congenital syphilis cases.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Given that this patient had syphilis, an STI, he was at risk for other STIs. In fact, the presence of an infection that causes genital ulcers, as does syphilis, has been established as a risk factor for HIV infection. Other STIs that he should be tested for include gonorrhea, <emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis>, chlamydia, and <emphasis>Mycoplasma genitalium</emphasis>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  <emphasis>T pallidum</emphasis> continues to be susceptible to penicllin G <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Unfortunately, a global shortage of benzathine penicillin has impacted availability of this drug for syphilis treatment <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Because of the detection of increasing azithromycin resistance to <emphasis>T. pallidum,</emphasis> this important second-line antimicrobial for the treatment of syphilis is no longer recommended <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Doxycycline continues to be recommended as a second-line drug, but compliance is often problematic <link linkend="ch0060s0002bib07">(7)</link>. <emphasis>In vitro</emphasis> studies suggest ceftriaxone as a possible second-line drug, but appropriate dosages have not been established.</para>
