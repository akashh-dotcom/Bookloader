      <sect1 id="ch0031s0004"><title>CASE 28</title><para>The patient was a previously healthy 11-year-old female who came to the emergency department (ED) in mid-September with a 2-day history of bloody diarrhea. Three days prior, she had the onset of fever, headache, and lower abdominal pain. Her diarrhea began as watery and became increasingly bloody. She denied any recent travel but reported that her brother also had bloody diarrhea. In her history, she said she had eaten a hamburger at a school picnic before the onset of the disease and had consumed spinach. There was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease or bloody stools.</para>
      <para>The patient’s vital signs were normal on physical examination, and the physical findings were unremarkable except for severe abdominal pain. Her stool was hemoccult positive and showed 2+ white blood cells (WBCs). A complete blood count was within normal limits except for a WBC of 14,900/μl with an absolute neutrophil count of 13,500/μl. She was given morphine in the ED for her abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound ruled out acute appendicitis but revealed thickened bowel loops consistent with colitis.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Acute diarrhea is almost always associated with an infectious etiology, which is most often viral. However, the presence of blood in the stool suggests more invasive disease and is more likely to indicate a bacterial infection <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Bacterial causes of diarrhea that may be associated with moderate to severe abdominal pain, blood, or increased white blood cells include toxigenic and enteroinvasive <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>, <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Vibrio cholerae</emphasis>, <emphasis>Clostridium perfringens</emphasis>, <emphasis>Campylobacter, Shigella,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Yersinia</emphasis>. The patient’s history indicates that she may have acquired diarrhea-causing bacteria from the food she ate at a picnic, especially since there was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease, and her brother also had bloody diarrhea.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>The stool from this patient had a sorbitol-negative organism (see the arrow pointing to the colorless colony surrounded by pink [sorbitol-fermenting] colonies on sorbitol Mac Conkey agar in <link linkend="ch0031s0004fg01">Fig. 28.1</link>). Isolates that fail to ferment sorbitol are unusual among <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>. One of the most common sorbitol-negative serotypes of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>is O157: H7, an organism associated with bloody diarrhea<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Subsequent serotyping of this sorbitol-negative colony confirmed it as <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>O157: H7. An alternative culture approach is to use chromogenic agar, which can detect sorbitol-negative <emphasis>E. coli. E. coli</emphasis>O157: H7 is also referred to as Shiga toxin-producing <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (STEC) because of its ability to produce Shiga toxin, the major virulence factor in the development of enterohemorrhagic colitis (inflammation of the colon with bloody diarrhea). Other serotypes of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>can produce Shiga toxin and thus cause enterohemorrhagic colitis. Prior to the widespread use of molecular multiplex panels for stool pathogens, O157: H7 was the most commonly implicated serotype; however, that trend has changed in recent years. According to the most recently published enteric disease surveillance report by the CDC, non-O157 serotypes are reported more often each year than O157 serotypes<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  All STEC strains produce Shiga toxin, and most strains produce intimin <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib02">(2)</link>. There are two forms of Shiga toxin, Stx 1 and Stx 2. STEC strains can produce both or either toxin. Biochemically, the two toxins are both AB5 toxins, with the B subunits binding to a specific glycosphingolipid receptor, GB3, found on both epithelial and renal endothelial cells. The A subunit is taken into the endoplasmic reticulum, where it inhibits protein synthesis at the ribosomal level, causes apoptosis, and promotes the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In animal models, these toxins have been shown to induce the pathophysiology associated with STEC. Stx 1 and Stx 2 are distinct toxins both sequentially and immunologically. Stx 2 represents a family of toxins with seven subtypes. Stx 2 is associated with the most severe manifestation of STEC infection, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Two subtypes, Stx 2a and Stx 2c, either alone or in combination, are most frequently associated with HUS.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Much of this patient’s history is typical of the clinical course of STEC infection. It often begins with watery diarrhea, which becomes increasingly bloody over the next 48 to 72 hours of illness. Severe abdominal pain, which was documented in this patient, is a key feature of this illness. Approximately half of patients have WBCs in feces. On the 5th day of illness, this patient began to experience signs of renal failure. The major complication of STEC infection is HUS, which ordinarily occurs between the 5th and 14th days of illness <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib04">(4)</link>. The anemia due to HUS is often severe, and a red blood cell transfusion is required in more than 80% of cases <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib05">(5)</link>. The patient had all three findings; her thrombocytopenia and anemia were severe. HUS is found primarily in children &lt;5 years of age and is the most common cause of renal failure in childhood. The mortality rate is ~5%. All strains associated with HUS have Stx 2 but not necessarily intimin or Stx 1. The pathophysiology of the disease is due to Stx 2 toxin variants binding to and damaging endothelial cells in the glomeruli and epithelial cells in the renal tubules. This damage is associated with fibrin deposition in the renal microvasculature, leading to hemolysis and renal failure.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  A small prospective study from 2005 was the first to demonstrate that intravenous (IV) volume expansion with isotonic saline protects patients with bloody diarrhea from developing HUS <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Since then, supportive evidence has mounted, including a systematic literature review and meta-analysis from 2017 demonstrating that the lack of IV fluid administration was a significant predictor of the development of HUS <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Volume expansion is believed to improve renal perfusion, counteract the consequences of thrombi formation, assist in avoiding ischemic organ damage, and maintain tubular flow. It is suggested that all patients with bloody diarrhea be treated intravenously with isotonic saline as early as possible to prevent or alleviate the HUS disease course since renal damage begins before the development of HUS manifestations. Protocols for this process are not well developed, and the volume of IV fluid administered should be based on the relative clinical assessment of each patient. This individual had three risk factors associated with HUS development—bloody diarrhea, female sex, and WBC count of &gt;13,000/μl—so intravascular volume expansion earlier rather than later in her disease course would likely have been beneficial.</para>
        <para>Early studies suggested that the use of antimicrobials in patients with STEC is considered a risk factor for developing HUS in children<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib08">(8)</link>. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2002 found no significant association between antibiotic use and the development of HUS in patients with diarrhea caused by <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>O157: H7<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Recent studies have shown mixed results, and some investigators have noted that results on the associated between antibiotic use and HUS in patients with <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> O157 are significantly impacted by the way HUS is defined, contributing to variability in findings and unclear risk <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Currently, due to the possible increased risk of HUS and the need to reduce the use of medications that could worsen renal function, antibiotic treatment for <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> O157 is not recommended <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib11">(11)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>   The patient’s illness was temporally associated with a large national outbreak of <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>E. coli</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis>O157: H7 due to consumption of contaminated bagged spinach from a specific supplier<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib12">(12)</link>. During the outbreak, approximately 200 individuals had confirmed infections with a specific <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>O157: H7 genotype found in several bags of implicated spinach. Sixteen percent developed HUS. The patient’s isolate was analyzed using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which is now the standard method for investigating foodborne outbreaks<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Historically, a microbial forensics technique called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to determine how closely related different bacterial isolates are genetically <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib14">(14)</link>. The process is akin to “fingerprinting” the organism, with the fingerprint type being referred to as a pulsotype. WGS has replaced this method, providing much more granular information (e. g., a more detailed fingerprint) than PFGE. The sequencing results from this patient’s isolate did not match the DNA fingerprint of the outbreak isolate. Even though the patient had consumed spinach, it is possible that she had a sporadic case related to another source.</para>
        <para>STEC infections can be obtained in a variety of ways. It is believed that most cases can be ultimately linked to cattle that carry this organism asymptomatically as part of their gastrointestinal microbiota. The most common way individuals become infected is by consuming undercooked ground beef contaminated with STEC from cattle gastrointestinal tracts or hides during processing.</para>
        <para>The patient also ate a hamburger before her illness, so it is possible that that was the source of her infection. Carriage rates in cattle are higher in the summer months when vegetables may grow in adjacent fields. The organism can contaminate surface waters through runoff from cattle pastures or feedlots. Individuals can swim in these contaminated surface waters and become infected. Leaf vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, and sprouts can be contaminated by field runoff of STEC-tainted water. These vegetables are particularly problematic because washing them sufficiently to remove these organisms is impossible. In addition, these vegetables are generally consumed without cooking, which could kill the organism. Leaf vegetables have been implicated in as many as 25% of STEC outbreaks in the United States. Petting zoos have also been the source of STEC infections, and as a result, either they have been discontinued or hand disinfectants are made available for use upon exiting the animal enclosures. Human-to-human spread via defecation in swimming pools or on the hands of caregivers in daycare centers has also been reported as a mode of STEC spread.</para>
        <para>STEC strains are relatively acid-stable, which enhances their infectivity. STEC has an inoculum size similar to that of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> (~1 to 100 organisms), making dissemination fairly efficient and increasing the likelihood of sporadic cases and outbreaks.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>The largest outbreak to date of non-O157: H7 STEC infections occurred in the summer of 2011 in Germany. It was due to a rarely encountered STEC strain,<emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>O104: H4. There were ~3,800 reported cases and 54 deaths. The transmission vehicle was sprouts used in salads and as garnishes. Interestingly, the largest <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>O157: H7 outbreak, which occurred in Japan in 1996 and caused almost 2,800 culture-confirmed cases, was also associated with the consumption of sprouts. One of the unusual findings in the German outbreak was the high rate of HUS (22% of O104: H4-infected individuals). The HUS rate is usually 5 to 10% in other large outbreaks. Additionally, the organism implicated in the German outbreak was an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer, which is unusual for intestinal<emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>E. coli </emphasis></emphasis></emphasis><link linkend="ch0031s0002bib15">(15)</link>.</para>
        <para>Further, 88% of the cases were seen in adults, with a predominance (68%) in women. This predominance was attributed to their preference for consuming sprouts. In the Japanese outbreak, all HUS cases were in children. HUS secondary to STEC is generally believed to be a disease primarily of children, making the HUS case distribution in female adults highly unusual. Like <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>O157: H7 associated with HUS, this strain carried<emphasis>stx 2</emphasis>, with the specific toxin variant being Stx 2a. It is worth noting that outbreaks of <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> have also been linked to the consumption of sprouts.</para>
        <para>Non-O157 strains of STEC are common causes of acute diarrhea and can potentially cause large outbreaks, as seen in Germany. A systematic review of these infections, published in 2017, demonstrated that the incidence of non-O157 infection in the United States has increased from 0.19 per 100,000 to 0.79 per 100,000<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Additionally, these strains are an important cause of HUS, identified in 14% of non-O157 epidemic disease cases and 9% of sporadic illness cases.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>How food is processed in much of the industrialized world has changed dramatically over the past few decades. Fast-food chains utilize large quantities of both ground beef and leaf vegetables. To ensure product consistency and adequate supply, many tons of ground beef containing the carcasses of hundreds of animals are purchased. During production of these multi-animal beef lots, a single STEC-tainted animal may contaminate the entire lot. These large lots are then distributed over many states. If the lot is contaminated and the meat is improperly cooked (i. e., it does not reach an internal temperature of 160°F), STEC infection may follow. Chopped leaf vegetables containing hundreds of heads may also be packaged in large lots for commercial customers. If these vegetables are contaminated during growing or processing, outbreaks may result. Multiple outbreaks consistent with both scenarios have been documented.</para>
        <para>Another reason these outbreaks are more readily detected is that actual case findings and associated epidemiologic investigations have improved. During the last two decades, the CDC, along with local and state health departments, has developed a laboratory-based surveillance system (PulseNet) for the detection of foodborne outbreaks<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib17">(17)</link>. A third reason is that many clinical microbiology laboratories now test stool directly for the two Shiga toxins. These assays can detect <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>O157: H7 strains and other toxin-producing serotypes. Finally, the widespread use of rapid and sensitive molecular multiplex panels has allowed accurate and rapid detection of toxigenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>   The three techniques for detection are culture on a selective medium, Shiga toxin detection, and molecular detection of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> and Shiga toxin genes. It should be emphasized that enterohemorrhagic colitis and HUS are both Shiga toxin-mediated diseases and that detecting either this toxin or the genes that encode it is a superior way of detecting STEC isolates. While culture is cost-effective, it is time consuming and has largely been replaced by Shiga toxin detection or molecular multiplex panels that detect a wide range of gastrointestinal pathogens.</para>
        <para>More than 100 serotypes of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>shown to produce Shiga toxin have been recovered from humans with STEC-associated diseases. The value of both toxin and toxin gene detection is much greater for detecting other serotypes of STEC believed to be responsible for infections in the United States. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is a method used for toxin detection and is more rapid and sensitive for detecting O157: H7 than culture and has the added advantage of detecting multiple serotypes.</para>
        <para>Since 2013, interest in and use of gastrointestinal molecular multiplex panels have increased. These assays offer advantages over conventional methods, including reduced sample volume requirements, broad coverage of pathogens without the need to select specific tests, and increased sensitivity and throughput<link linkend="ch0031s0002bib18">(18)</link>. False positives can occur with EIA and molecular tests. A drawback of nonculture methods for detecting STEC is that the organism is not readily available for epidemiologic investigation. Isolation of toxin-producing, non-O157: H7 strains from enrichment broth is laborious because non-O157: H7 strains lack a clearly identifiable phenotypic characteristic like being sorbitol negative, which makes identification of O157: H7 strains comparatively straightforward. Since 2009, the CDC has recommended that stool samples should be routinely cultured for <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> O157 and simultaneously assayed for non-O157 STEC with a test that detects Shiga toxins (or the genes that encode them). This recommendation has been controversial in the clinical microbiology community because of the expense involved in performing both tests, especially in a clinical setting, where this is likely to be a low-yield effort <link linkend="ch0031s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Some clinical laboratories that use methods other than culture may send stool samples positive for STEC by a molecular test to their state public health laboratory for additional testing.</para>
