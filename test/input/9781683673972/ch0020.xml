      <sect1 id="ch0020s0004"><title>CASE 17</title><para>This patient was a 61-year-old North Carolina resident with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema who received a bilateral lung transplant. Subsequent immunosuppressive therapy included methylprednisone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. During hospitalization, the patient also received cefuroxime, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and acyclovir as prophylaxis, but no antifungal prophylaxis was initiated. Posttransplantation, the patient was poorly responsive and had complications, including coagulopathy, hypotension, and hypoxia, resulting in increased oxygen requirements. Laboratory findings were consistent with liver, pancreas, and kidney dysfunction, and the patient ultimately required hemodialysis. Chest radiograph images during the first postoperative week indicated bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities consistent with edema or infection.</para>
      <para>At 2 weeks posttransplantation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained. CSF analysis showed &lt;1 red blood cell/mm<superscript>3</superscript> and 1 total nucleated cell/mm<superscript>3</superscript> (22% lymphocytes, 63% monocytes, 15% other cells). The CSF contained 32 mg of protein/dl. A glucose level determination was not performed. The Gram stain showed no polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no organisms. The CSF culture was reported as no growth at 7 days, and peripheral blood cultures were negative after 5 days of incubation. Bronchial washings from the donor lungs at the time of transplantation grew methicillin-susceptible <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>. <emphasis>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</emphasis> and coagulase-negative <emphasis>Staphylococcus</emphasis> spp. were recovered from subsequent washings.

      <para>Less than 1 month postoperatively, the patient died, and an autopsy was performed. Anatomically, the patient had extensive pneumonia, multiple small abscesses in the spleen, and extensive acute fungal pericarditis and pyelonephritis. Hematoxylin and eosin and Gomori’s methenamine silver (GMS) staining of lungs, pericardium, and spleen sections revealed numerous endosporulating spherules consistent with <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> (<link linkend="ch0020s0004fg01">Fig. 17.1</link>).

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Pneumonia is a frequent complication in patients with solid organ transplants, and the potential causative pathogens include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and, less commonly, parasites. Deciding on the differential diagnosis for pneumonia can be exceptionally challenging in patients receiving solid organ transplants because various organisms may cause disease and differentiating between these causes relies on several nonspecific factors such as age, environmental exposures, and radiographic infiltrate patterns <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Patients with lung transplants are at risk of developing pneumonia from donor-derived infection and their own airway colonization. Recent data demonstrate that bacterial pneumonia is most common in these patients, but fungal and viral pneumonia together accounts for more than 24% of episodes <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para>This patient’s initial chest radiograph showed progressive bilateral infiltrates and worsening alveolar consolidation. Although the radiograph was unable to specifically identify an etiology, diffuse bilateral infiltrates suggest cytomegalovirus, respiratory viruses,<emphasis>Mycoplasma</emphasis>, <emphasis>Legionella</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis>. Additionally, micronodular or miliary infiltrates may suggest endemic fungi, other fungal infections, or, in the case of adenopathy and empyema, tuberculosis <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Understanding the travel history and environmental exposures for both donor and recipient is important for further narrowing down the differential and targeting testing. For example, patients with a travel history to regions with endemic fungi are at an increased risk of activating a latent infection after immunosuppression. Alternatively, receipt of lungs from a donor with recent relevant exposure increases the risk of infection in the recipient posttransplant. Because the factors for narrowing the differential are so nonspecific, particularly when there is no clear travel history or environmental exposure, testing is typically broad and covers a wide breadth of pathogens.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The disease coccidioidomycosis, also known as “Valley fever,” is caused by the dimorphic fungus <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis>, which is endemic in dry climates <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib03">(3)</link>. <emphasis>C. immitis</emphasis> is found primarily in California while <emphasis>C. posadasii</emphasis> is more widespread and found in Arizona, Texas, Utah, Mexico, and Central and South America. Nonetheless, the clinical disease is the same. In the soil, <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> exists in a mycelial state, and the hyphae develop into arthroconidia that are highly infectious and airborne. Inhaled arthroconidia are the source of human infection. Once in tissue, <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> arthroconidia develop into thick-walled spherules, each containing endospores (<link linkend="ch0020s0004fg01">Fig. 17.1</link>). Endospores are released when the spherule ruptures, and each endospore can develop into a new spherule, and thus the infection progresses <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para>In immunocompetent individuals, disseminated coccidioidomycosis is extremely rare. Infection with <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> is usually subclinical (∼60%) but may occasionally present as a nonspecific influenza-like syndrome or, less commonly, as pneumonia <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib05">(5)</link>. It is estimated based on delayed dermal hypersensitivity testing that, in areas where this organism is endemic, one-third of the local population is infected with <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Populations that are at risk for developing serious complications from <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> infection include those with diabetes mellitus; pregnant individuals; and immunocompromised patients, such as those at the extremes of age, individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus, and transplant recipients <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Coccidioidomycosis in transplant patients typically occurs as a result of either a primary infection posttransplantation in areas where this organism is endemic or reactivation of latent infection. The medical literature indicates that reactivation of latent <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> infection likely represents the majority of coccidioidomycosis posttransplant cases, primarily occurring in patients who have resided in or visited these areas (<link linkend="ch0020s0002bib08">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib09">9</link>). In fact, some transplant centers in areas of endemicity test potential organ recipients for <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> serology and prophylactically treat those with a positive result or a history of coccidioidal infection (<link linkend="ch0020s0002bib08">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib10">10</link>).</para>
        <para>There are rare reports of transmission due to infected donor lungs, liver, and kidney (<link linkend="ch0020s0002bib11">11</link>, <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib12">12</link>). Infection from donor lungs has been reported to develop in the immediate postoperative period <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Since the patient reported here was hospitalized during the entire postoperative period and was a North Carolina resident, it is unlikely that <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> was acquired as a primary infection posttransplantation. Therefore, the patient’s coccidioidomycosis most likely developed due to reactivation of a latent infection, provided by either the patient’s own latent infection or the donor lungs. The recipient’s lack of a travel history outside of North Carolina and the accelerated postoperative clinical course suggest that the donor lungs were the source of the coccidioidal infection. The donor was a 30-year-old North Carolina resident without a significant past medical or travel history. However, the donor had visited Mexico 2 years prior to organ donation.</para>
        <para>The incidence of postoperative fungal infections in lung transplant recipients is reportedly 15 to 35%<link linkend="ch0020s0002bib13">(13)</link>. In this patient population, the most commonly isolated fungal organisms are <emphasis>Candida, Fusarium</emphasis> (see <ulink url="ch0067.xml#ch0067">case 64</ulink>), and <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> spp. due to their ubiquity. While dissemination rates of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> are low in the general population, they can be as high as 30% among patients who received solid organ transplants, and 66% of post-transplant cases occur within the first year of transplant <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib14">(14)</link>. However, in areas where <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> is not endemic, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is often delayed due to a low index of suspicion <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Therefore, for solid organ transplant recipients who reside in areas of endemicity and who have a positive <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> serology, or who are receiving a donor organ from a resident of an area of endemicity, antifungal prophylaxis with an azole may be prudent. It is also of great importance for areas of nonendemicity, where <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> serology is not routinely performed, to establish the patient’s travel history to assess the relative risk of coccidioidomycosis due to latent reactivation. Further, as demonstrated in this case, previous travel history of the donor may also prove to be beneficial. Broadening the view of patients who are at high risk for <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> reactivation and applying appropriate prophylaxis may prevent the potentially fatal posttransplant complication of disseminated coccidioidomycosis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>   Medical laboratory scientists and pregnant people, particularly in areas of endemicity, are at increased risk of severe or disseminated <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> infection.</para>
        <para>Laboratory-acquired infections with dimorphic fungi, and especially <emphasis>Coccidioides,</emphasis> are a real risk to medical laboratory scientists. During the process of opening and examining a petri dish, it is possible for the arthroconidia of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis>, which are easily aerosolized, to become airborne and to infect a medical laboratory scientist. This has been well documented and has resulted in the deaths of laboratory staff <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib16">(16)</link>. As a result, medical laboratories routinely require the use of biological safety cabinets for the isolation and identification of molds. In addition, all fungal cultures that are plated on petri dishes are routinely closed with either tape or a commercially available product such as Shrink Seal to prevent the plates from being inadvertently opened. This is not, however, the routine for bacterial cultures. Occasionally a mold grows on bacterial media. It is important that medical laboratory scientists be aware of this possibility and as a matter of good safety technique acquire the habit of looking at the plates before opening them, to minimize the risk of laboratory-acquired infection. The other, less important reason why fungal cultures should only be opened in a biological safety cabinet is to prevent cross-contamination of other cultures by the fungal conidial elements.</para>
        <para>Pregnancy is a significant risk factor for the development of severe or disseminated<emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> infection <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib17">(17)</link>. The risk of severe disease increases with each later stage of pregnancy, and this is believed to be due to various components of autoimmunity. First, cell-mediated immunity is significantly reduced in pregnant patients with previous exposure to <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis>, and research has shown that pregnant individuals who develop an acute infection fail to develop a sufficient immune response. Additionally, alterations in estradiol and progesterone levels during pregnancy have been shown to increase the growth of <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib18">(18)</link>. This, paired with an exaggerated proinflammatory response that occurs in pregnant patients, contributes to more severe and disseminated disease.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  The presence of barrel-shaped alternating arthroconidia with disjunctor cells is consistent with <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> spp. (<link linkend="ch0020s0001fg02">Fig. 17.2</link>). Arthroconidia are formed by the fragmentation of hyphae during sporulation. Although there are several other fungi that produce arthroconidia, they are not likely to produce this clinical syndrome. Historically, to definitively identify thermally dimorphic fungi, it was necessary to demonstrate that the fungus can convert from a mold form (at room temperature) to a yeast form (at body temperature). This method could not be used for <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> because the non-mold phase of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis>is a spherule in tissue and does not grow in the laboratory. However, advancements in diagnostic technology (e. g., mass spectrometry and sequencing) have replaced this practice. The diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis often requires a multipronged approach using both direct and indirect methods.</para>
        <para>The identification of<emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> from culture is still considered the gold standard for diagnosis <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Specimen types that should be submitted for testing include lower respiratory samples, soft tissue from lesions, CSF, or joint aspirates, depending on the suspected site of infection. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) can be used to confirm the identification after organism inactivation. Additionally, sequence-based identification may be performed, but there are no commercial testing options available currently.</para>

        <para>Serological testing is available in many forms and is commonly used to diagnose immunocompetent hosts. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for anticoccidioidal immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) are commercially available and commonly used for initial screening of early<emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> infection due to their increased sensitivity compared to other serological tests such as immunodiffusion for tube precipitin (IDTP) or immunodiffusion complement fixation (IDCF) <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib20">(20)</link>. However, a single positive EIA is considered the least compelling evidence for confirmation of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> infection, and false positives can occur. Because of this, additional testing with IDTP and IDCF is recommended. The specificity of IDTP for IgM is higher than that of EIA, thus rendering it a common confirmatory test for positive EIAs. Complement fixation (CF) test detects IgG antibodies to the chitinase antigen and is considered less sensitive than immunodiffusion <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib21">(21)</link>. This test is less useful in diagnosis, but can be helpful in prognosis or measuring disease severity and progression.</para>
        <para>Due to the lower sensitivity of antibody detection in immunocompromised hosts, a combination of test methods in addition to serology should be considered. There is one commercially available nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for the detection of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> from clinical samples, and although the data are limited, the performance seems to be comparable to culture. Next-generation sequencing options are available, but the application to clinical diagnostics is limited due to the lack of a commercially available test and workflow and infrastructure challenges <link linkend="ch0020s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
