        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Crohn’s disease is due to dysregulation of immune homeostasis in the intestinal tract, resulting in increased inflammation <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This inflammation is mediated by a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and interleukin-12 (IL-12). Inflammation likely targets microbial antigens of the microbiome that cross the intestinal mucosa in part due to the disruption of tight junctions between cells of the epithelial gut mucosa and increased intestinal permeability, two well-recognized features of this disease. This inflammatory response causes the pathology associated with this disease, including mucosal erosion and ulceration, granuloma formation, and in advanced disease, fistula formation. Common clinical features include bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, both of which were present in this patient. Since dysregulation of the inflammatory response is the key feature of Crohn’s disease, suppressing this inflammatory response is a key therapeutic strategy. This patient had a “flare” of his disease, which means worsening intestinal inflammation, often manifesting as bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  As more is learned about Crohn’s disease, three factors appear to be important in the evolution of the disease <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The overarching factor in this disease is dysregulation of the immune system, with upregulation of certain proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF-α and perhaps downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. A second important factor is alterations in the microbiome in Crohn’s patients <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The microbiome tends to be less diverse in Crohn’s patients, with fewer anti-inflammatory bacteria and decreased levels of the microbial metabolite butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory properties. The third factor is genetic. As our understanding of the human genome has increased, we have learned that certain polymorphisms, particularly in <emphasis>NOD2</emphasis>, a gene for the intracellular pattern recognition receptor, have a regulatory role in the inflammatory response to gut bacteria <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Dysfunction in this gene may result in dysregulation of inflammation.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Two factors significantly impact Crohn’s disease rates. On the protective side is breastfeeding, which tends to decline with economic development, while on the negative side is tobacco smoking, which tends to increase with increased income <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib01">(1)</link>. A low-fat, high-fiber plant-based diet is associated with a gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of greater diversity that is believed to be anti-inflammatory <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib02">(2)</link>. With higher disposable income, two factors are associated with changes in the microbiome that are considered proinflammatory. One is increased consumption of animal protein, which increases the fat content of the diet while reducing its fiber content. This change in diet is associated with increases in proinflammatory <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> and decreases in anti-inflammatory bacteria such as  <emphasis>Firmicutes</emphasis> and <emphasis>Bacteroides</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The other is an increased use of antimicrobials to treat childhood infections, resulting in decreased diversity in the GI microbiome <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Other factors associated with Crohn’s disease are urbanization and improved hygiene levels <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Exactly how these factors increase the risk for Crohn’s disease is not entirely clear, although their impact on alterations in the GI microbiome may be a contributory factor.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The patient was receiving aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy, typically used to resolve Crohn’s disease flares. Cyclosporine and 6-mercaptopurine target proinflammatory lymphocytes. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial especially active against <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>, was used as a prophylactic agent for infection. Current clinical practice guidelines do not support the prophylactic use of antimicrobials in treating Crohn’s disease <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib03">(3)</link>. The patient was both neutropenic and anemic when he presented with his continuing symptoms. Although the anemia might be attributed to bloody diarrhea, neutropenia was unlikely due to bloody diarrhea. A well-recognized side effect of all three of these agents is the suppression of bone marrow hematopoiesis. Both prednisone and mesalamine were continued because the patient needed continued anti-inflammatory treatment, and these agents are not as suppressive of hematopoiesis. Interestingly, a recent review has shown that mesalamine is ineffective in treating Crohn's disease flares, and it is no longer recommended for that use <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are now used to treat Crohn’s disease. The most widely used MAbs are infliximab and adalimumab <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib03">(3)</link>. These two molecules inhibit TNF-α, a key proinflammatory cytokine, and have been found to be effective in the treatment of Crohn’s disease flares as well as maintenance therapy (<link linkend="ch0073s0002bib03">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib04">4</link>). In patients refractory to the TNF-α-inhibitory MAbs, two other MAbs are currently recommended: vedolizumab and ustekinumab <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Vedolizumab blocks the migration of leukocytes into gut tissues, while ustekinumab inhibits the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Our current understanding of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection is that disruption of the intestinal microbiome by antimicrobial agents results in the elimination of microbes thought to be inhibitory for <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>, creating an intestinal environment permissive to its growth. Observational studies suggest that fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) effectively treats relapse of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infections by restoring the inhibitory microbes to the gut microbiome <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
        <para>Analysis of the gut microbiome in patients with Crohn’s disease shows a less diverse microbiome than controls, with a reduction in gut microbes believed to be anti-inflammatory (<link linkend="ch0073s0002bib01">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib02">2</link>). Results of small case series and a small randomized trial of FMT to determine if enriching the gut microbiome with microbes believed to be anti-inflammatory could reduce the frequency of Crohn’s disease flares have been inconclusive <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib06">(6)</link>. For now, data are insufficient to justify FMT as a therapeutic approach for the prevention or treatment of Crohn’s flares.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  The Gram stain shows Gram-positive bacilli, also called rods. Some of the organisms have subterminal spores. The other thing that is striking is that there are no WBCs present. Typically, one would expect to see many WBCs, primarily neutrophils, in the Gram stain from infected tissues. The reason for their absence will be explained in the <phrase>answer to question 9</phrase>. Given the clinical setting (see the <phrase>answer to question 8</phrase> for more details) and the presence of spores and absence of WBCs, the organism is most likely one of the histotoxic <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp., with <emphasis>Clostridium perfringens</emphasis> and <emphasis>Clostridium septicum</emphasis> being the most commonly encountered species <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  On physical exam it was noted the patient had crepitus, or gas in tissue. Imaging studies confirmed this finding. The rapid onset of swelling, crepitus, and hemorrhagic bullous lesions are all characteristics of gas gangrene <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Gas gangrene often brings to mind the image of a traumatic dirty wound. Vascular compromise in the traumatized tissue results in loss of blood supply, creating anaerobic conditions. Environmental anaerobic organisms introduced into compromised tissue during a traumatic event find ideal conditions for growth. <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. are particularly pathogenic in this setting because of the histotoxic virulence factors that they produce and their rapid growth rates <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Growth rates are driven by rapid glucose metabolism. An important by-product of this metabolism is high levels of gas, which is trapped in tissue, causing crepitus.</para>
        <para>However, this patient did not have initial trauma, so what was the likely sequence of events resulting in his gas gangrene development? This patient likely had a syndrome referred to as “atraumatic” gas gangrene. In atraumatic gas gangrene, there is no obvious source of infection but gas gangrene occurs, typically in an extremity. The most common etiologic agent associated with this syndrome is <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis>, the organism recovered from this patient. The development of atraumatic gas gangrene results from bacteremia with the seeding of tissue. <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> bacteremia is most commonly seen in patients with an intestinal malignancy <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib07">(7)</link>. This malignancy causes necrosis in the intestinal mucosa, which serves as a portal of entry for the organism into the bloodstream. Why <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> shows this association much more frequently than other clostridial species is unknown, although its tolerance to oxygen (aerotolerance) may play a role. <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> bacteremia is unusual in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease even though there is ulceration of the intestinal mucosa, creating a potential portal of entry for the organism. However, the high level of inflammation seen in this patient population likely ensures the immune clearance of these organisms. This patient was not a typical Crohn’s disease patient in that he was leukopenic. His leukopenia may have compromised his ability to clear bacteria that penetrated from the gut to the lamina propria, resulting in the observed bacteremia complicated by gas gangrene.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  The major virulence factor of all clostridia that cause gas gangrene is pore-forming toxins that induce membrane lysis of various cell types, including leukocytes. The toxin produced by <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> is called α-toxin <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib07">(7)</link>. These toxins are histotoxic and are responsible for the massive myonecrosis that is characteristic of this disease process. They also cause leukostasis in blood vessels in areas of tissue destruction, resulting in localized ischemia and further cell death. No neutrophils were likely seen on Gram stain because the action of this toxin had lysed them.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Amputation to treat gas gangrene infections is a time-honored therapy, widely used in the American Civil War and the First World War following soil-contaminated wounds caused by high-caliber bullets and artillery shrapnel. With improved wound and surgical care and the advent of antibiotics, gas gangrene was less common during the Second World War. Gas gangrene is now unusual following combat injury because of rapid battlefield evacuation facilitated by helicopters and evolving wound and surgical care. Unfortunately for this patient, extensive debridement or amputation is common in patients with atraumatic gas gangrene. Because of this, removing all necrotic tissue is the only truly effective therapy, with antimicrobials and other wound care strategies being adjunctive. This is necessary because clostridia are among the fastest-growing human pathogens. Additionally, α-toxin produced by <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> is histotoxic, causing rapid cell death and massive tissue necrosis. The organism also produces additional toxins, including DNase, hyaluronidase, protease, hemolysin (septicolysin), and neuraminidase, which allow further tissue damage while providing nutrients, which enhance the organism’s growth rate.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  Intravenous penicillin G is a recommended therapy for clostridial gas gangrene infections. Despite its use to treat clostridial infections for more than 80 years, penicillin treatment failures in the gas gangrene-producing clostridia have not been reported. However, it is important to note that there are no randomized controlled trials comparing penicillin G to other antimicrobials or antimicrobial combinations. Animal studies suggest that clindamycin is more effective in treating clostridial gas gangrene, but clindamycin resistance may occur in <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. This efficacy is likely due to clindamycin inhibiting protein synthesis, thus stopping the production of the various clostridial toxins. As a result, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that the combination of penicillin G and clindamycin be used to treat these infections <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib08">(8)</link>. It must be emphasized that antimicrobial therapy is secondary and that the primary intervention in this infection is emergent surgical debridement with amputation when judged necessary.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">12.</emphasis>  The primary therapy for gas gangrene is surgical debridement with combination antimicrobial therapy as a secondary therapy. The use of hyperbaric oxygen to treat gas gangrene is controversial. The idea is that if the patient breathes higher oxygen concentrations, oxygen levels will reach levels toxic to anaerobic bacteria found in infected tissue. There are few data to support its use in this setting. Further, <emphasis>C. septicum</emphasis> may be more refractory to hyperbaric oxygen treatment because of its aerotolerance. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not support its use in the treatment of gas gangrene <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib08">(8)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">13.</emphasis>  An addition to the armamentarium for the treatment of wound infection is the wound vacuum. The “wound vac” applies negative pressure to the wound bed. It is thought to increase blood flow to the covered area. In animal studies, this increased blood flow results in increased fibrocytes in the wound site, which promotes healing <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib09">(9)</link>. It also draws off fluid, reduces localized edema, and removes substances thought to be inhibitory to wound healing, although the exact nature of these substances is not well defined. There are several randomized controlled studies of the promotion of wound healing by wound vacuum. They show that wound vacuum reduces the risk of postsurgical infection compared to standard surgical dressings <link linkend="ch0073s0002bib09">(9)</link>. The meta-analysis did not specifically address patients with gas gangrene but a wide variety of postsurgical wounds.</para>
