      <sect1 id="ch0025s0004"><title>CASE 22</title><para>A 39-year-old otherwise healthy male reported 10 days of persistent watery diarrhea. He noticed a rapid 12-lb weight loss over 8 days, decreasing his weight from 242 lb to 230 lb. Alongside diarrhea, he described decreased appetite, nausea, intermittent cramping abdominal pain preceding bowel movements, and 2 to 5 yellow/green slimy bowel movements per day. He reported tenesmus that improved postdefecation. He noted that his symptoms began 8 to 10 days previously, coinciding with exposure to raw sewage when a pipe burst at his workplace, a wastewater treatment plant. He denied fevers, chills, vomiting, or hematochezia. He had attempted dietary modifications with bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast without relief. He was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 138/84 mm Hg, pulse of 82 beats/minute, temperature of 37°C, respiratory rate of 16 per minute, and SpO<subscript>2</subscript> of 97%.</para>

      <para>The provider ordered several tests, including a molecular gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens multiplex test (instead of stool ova and parasite exam), complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipase, and urinalysis with microscopy with culture reflex. Since the patient was well-appearing, he was discharged with recommendations to increase fluid intake at home and follow-up with his primary care provider. The patient was also given a referral to gastroenterology for further assessment and management, given the clinical picture and the need to investigate potential underlying GI pathology.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>Given the patient’s history of exposure to raw sewage and the presentation of watery diarrhea, infectious etiologies must be considered. Pathogens such as bacteria (e. g.,<emphasis>Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter</emphasis>), viruses (e. g., norovirus, rotavirus), and parasites (e. g.,<emphasis>Giardia, Cryptosporidium</emphasis>) can cause acute infectious diarrhea. Additionally, HIV should be considered since it can cause diarrhea and weight loss. While patients should generally be aware of their HIV status, clinicians should always consider it in a differential when a patient’s symptoms are consistent with the disease. The patient’s symptoms of watery, yellow/green bowel movements with associated tenesmus align with infectious diarrhea. The presence of slimy mucoid consistency in the patient’s bowel movements suggests a possible component of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib01">(1)</link>. IBS can present with abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and mucoid diarrhea. However, the significant weight loss (12 lb over 8 days), decreased appetite, and fatigue raise concerns beyond typical IBS presentation. While less likely, given the acute onset of symptoms and absence of overt signs of inflammation on the exam, inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) cannot be entirely ruled out. The weight loss, decreased appetite, and fatigue may suggest a more systemic process, though further evaluation is needed to confirm or exclude this diagnosis. The patient’s well-appearing status and unremarkable initial laboratory results suggest that the condition may not be severe. However, given the concerning symptoms of weight loss and fatigue, additional investigations are warranted to determine the underlying cause of the diarrhea.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The cyst form of <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> is swallowed either in contaminated food or water or following the placement of a fecally soiled object in the mouth <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The cysts excyst in the small intestine in response to stomach acidity and pancreatic enzymes, releasing the trophozoite. Sucking disks on the ventral surface of the trophozoite allow adherence to the intestinal mucosa. The trophozoite damages the intestinal brush border, resulting in malabsorptive diarrhea. Malabsorptive diarrhea is characterized by frothy, foul-smelling stools 1 to 2 hours after a meal.</para>
        <para><emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> begins its life cycle when a host ingests sporulated oocysts, leading to excystation and the release of four infective sporozoites. Excystation can be triggered by various factors such as reducing conditions, increased temperature, and bile salts. These sporozoites then glide over intestinal cells, aided by actin-myosin-tubulin-dependent motility, eventually invading host cells. During this process, they release proteins that aid in attachment and invasion. Infection with <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> results in watery diarrhea and abdominal pain.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  There are various ways these parasites can be identified in the clinical microbiology laboratory, and the chosen method often depends on staff competency, resources, and cost. Microscopic examination of stool samples using special staining techniques such as trichrome stain or modified acid-fast stain allows for the visualization of <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> cysts and trophozoites, and <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> oocysts <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib03">(3)</link>. This method remains a widely used diagnostic tool due to its accessibility and relatively low cost. Direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) involves direct staining of the stool to visualize parasites with fluorescent-labeled antibodies specific to <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> or <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> antigens (<link linkend="ch0025s0001fg01">Fig. 22.1</link>). Rapid enzyme immunoassays may be used to detect <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> or <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> antigens quickly from human stool. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) target specific <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> DNA sequences, allowing for highly sensitive and specific detection of these parasites in stool samples. NAATs, including molecular multiplex panels, have become increasingly popular in clinical laboratories due to their ability to detect low parasite concentrations and their potential for automated high-throughput testing. There are Food and Drug Administration-cleared commercial assays for various viruses, bacteria, and parasites <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib04">(4)</link>. While these tests offer significantly improved sensitivity and turnaround time, their implementation and use should be considered in the context of the patient’s clinical presentation and other considerations, such as whether the infection will be treated or impact hospital infection prevention procedures <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> infection is typically treated with the antimicrobial metronidazole <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Metronidazole is an interesting agent because it acts against protozoans and most anaerobic bacteria. Other agents have been found to have anti-<emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> activity, but metronidazole is most commonly used to treat <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> infections. Oral rehydration will also be valuable in managing this patient, especially once malabsorption is controlled by metronidazole. There are significant gaps in developing anti-<emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> agents, although nitazoxanide has been approved in the United States to treat both <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib05">(5)</link>. It is rarely used in cases like the one presented here, as it is usually reserved for patients with protracted diarrheal disease courses or children with chronic diarrhea in areas of endemicity. The main focus of treatment in patients such as the one presented here would be oral fluid replacement therapy.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Because both of these agents are resistant to disinfection by halides, municipal water supplies that use surface water depend on flocculation and filtration to eliminate these organisms. In particular, <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> cysts are highly resistant to chlorine, and are a leading cause of swimming pool-associated gastroenteritis <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib06">(6)</link>. In an outbreak in 2023, 38% of a Massachusetts college swim team developed diarrhea after participating in a week-long swim training in Puerto Rico <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Further investigation discovered that the outbreak stemmed from one ill swimmer who had tested positive for <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis>. In addition to swimming pools, outbreaks with these agents have occurred when there has been failure or disabling of flocculation or filtration steps in water purification. In Pittsfield, MA, an outbreak with &gt;700 confirmed <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Giardia</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> cases occurred between 1985 and 1986 when the filtration plant was taken offline for upgrading and the only treatment available for a secondary water supply was chlorination but not flocculation/filtration <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Just before the beginning of the outbreak, residents of this city complained that their tap water was turbid. In one of the largest waterborne outbreaks ever recorded, an estimated 400,000 individuals had <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis>-associated diarrhea in Milwaukee, WI, in 1993 <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib09">(9)</link>. In that outbreak, there was a malfunction in the flocculation/filtration of the water in one of the two city water plants, which obtained “raw” water from Lake Michigan. The treated water from the implicated plant had increased turbidity levels in the period proximal to the outbreak. In addition, illness was much more common in individuals who lived in areas supplied by the implicated water plant, and ice made from water from this plant during the time of the outbreak contained <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> oocysts, all of which point to contaminated water produced by this water plant as the source of the outbreak.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Epidemiologic surveillance data demonstrate that while waterborne exposures are the most common causes of <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis> infection, other routes of transmission exist and are commonly associated with disease, particularly in children. In fact, the highest incidence of <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Giardia</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> infection occurs in children between the ages of 1 to 9 years, with approximately 43% of person-to-person cases occurring in daycare centers <link linkend="ch0025s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Spread may occur when infected children in daycare get fecal material on their hands and touch toys, which other children handle or put in their mouths. Furthermore, daycare staff may spread the parasite when their hands become contaminated after changing diapers and then handling food that uninfected children consume (e. g., cutting up fruit). Ideally, staff who change diapers should not be involved in food preparation, but this is often impossible in small daycare centers or those based out of a person’s home. Additionally, people may become infected by consuming untreated water in areas that may have been contaminated by animal feces (e. g., hikers and campers), traveling to areas of endemicity, or consuming contaminated food<link linkend="ch0025s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Food contamination can occur at any stage of manufacturing, processing, or preparation. Washing fruits and vegetables may not be enough to eliminate <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> oocysts since they can stick to the surface of food items and permeate leafy greens.</para>
