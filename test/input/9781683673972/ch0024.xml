      <sect1 id="ch0024s0004"><title>CASE 21</title><para>This 18-year-old male presented to the outpatient medical clinic for evaluation of diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. The patient first noted mild abdominal discomfort and three loose bowel movements per day 1 week prior to evaluation. Two days before evaluation, he noted intermittent, crampy periumbilical abdominal pain. He denied drinking well water, fever, blood in the stool, relation of the pain to meals, dysuria, or hematuria.</para>
      <para>On examination, the patient was afebrile and had normal vital signs. The abdominal examination was notable for mild lower abdominal tenderness. The fecal examination demonstrated a greenish, watery stool that was negative for occult blood.</para>
      <para>Laboratory evaluation included a normal white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Examination of the feces microscopically was remarkable for the presence of white blood cells.

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Both <emphasis>Vibrio</emphasis> and <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> spp. are slightly curved, Gram-negative rods that cause diarrhea (<link linkend="ch0024s0004fg01">Fig. 21.1</link>). The pathogenesis of the most important <emphasis>Vibrio</emphasis> species, <emphasis>V. cholerae</emphasis>, is due primarily to the production of an exotoxin, cholera toxin, that causes secretory diarrhea. The stools of patients with severe cases of cholera have a “rice water” appearance. Because of the secretory, noninflammatory nature of the diarrhea, white blood cells are rarely seen in the feces of patients with cholera. Campylobacter spp. cause an invasive diarrhea distinguished by the presence of white blood cells in the stool <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Up to 50% of patients with <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> diarrhea may have bloody stools due to the presence of red blood cells. The diarrhea seen in this patient is consistent with a <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection, and <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> was isolated from his stool (<link linkend="ch0024s0004fg02">Fig. 21.2</link>). Abdominal pain, as was seen in this patient, is an important although nonspecific feature of the clinical presentation of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> gastroenteritis. Other causes of invasive diarrhea include <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis>, <emphasis>Escherichia coli, Salmonella</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, and should be considered when a patient presents with gastrointestinal symptoms and dysentery (e. g., blood and/or mucus in the stool).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  It is important to remember that the facultative aerobic fecal microbiota consists of approximately 10<superscript>7</superscript> to 10<superscript>9</superscript>CFU/g of feces and that finding an enteric pathogen, which may represent only a small fraction of the microbiota, is akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack. Selective media, such as Hektoen and Mac Conkey agars, used to isolate <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. from feces do not support the growth of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> spp. <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib02">(2)</link>. To further complicate matters, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> spp. are microaerophilic organisms (organisms that require lower levels of oxygen than what is present in the atmosphere), so culture conditions that will support their growth must be used. Finally, <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis>, the most frequently recovered <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> species, grows optimally at 42°C, the body temperature of chickens, a natural host of this organism. Many laboratories inoculate fecal specimens onto <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>-selective agar and incubate these plates at 42°C under microaerophilic conditions in an attempt to isolate <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis>. This approach is problematic since other <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> spp. either fail to grow on certain types of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>-selective agar or cannot grow at 42°C. Alternative methods are available for the detection of these species.</para>
        <para>Nonculture methods have been developed to detect <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. coli</emphasis>, the two species most likely to cause diarrheal infections <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib03">(3)</link>. One assay detects <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>-specific antigens directly in stool specimens by the enzyme immunoassay method. The accuracy of these tests approaches that of culture, and they can be done in &lt;2 hours versus a minimum of 2 days for culture. Alternatively, molecular multiplex tests that detect multiple enteric pathogens, including <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis>, <emphasis>C. coli</emphasis>, <emphasis>C. lari</emphasis>, and/or <emphasis>C. upsaliensis</emphasis>, are also being used with increasing frequency, replacing culture and antigen testing. An example multiplex test can detect the nucleic acids of common bacterial (<emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>, pathogenic <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis>, <emphasis>Shigella, Vibrio, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Yersinia enterocolitica</emphasis>), parasitic (<emphasis>Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora</emphasis>, <emphasis>Entamoeba histolytica</emphasis>), and viral (adenovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus, sapovirus) pathogens in ~1 hour.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>   <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> and <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp. are the two most frequently recovered bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the United States. <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> is estimated to cause 1.5 million illnesses yearly in the United States <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib04">(4)</link>. <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis>, like all enteric pathogens, is spread by the fecal-oral route. A recent meta-analysis assessing campylobacteriosis risk factors demonstrated that international travel was the most important risk factor, followed by undercooked poultry consumption or handling, environmental exposure, and direct contact with farm animals <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib05">(5)</link>. It is important to note that travel-related infections are often associated with consuming contaminated food and exposure to animals and environmental factors, and this relationship is complex. The regions with the highest levels of risk for campylobacteriosis include Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</para>
        <para>The risk of infection through consumption or handling of undercooked poultry is associated with high contamination rates. An analysis of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> contamination on meat between 1994 and 2018 demonstrated that <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> was isolated from 90% of turkey carcasses, 31.5% of market hog carcasses, and 0.2% of ground beef samples <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib06">(6)</link>. In 2018, 1 in 5 chicken carcasses was <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> positive at slaughter, and 1 in 11 chicken breast samples was positive at retail.</para>
        <para>Outbreaks of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection are not commonly reported in the United States but are increasing in frequency. For example, the CDC reports that the average number of outbreaks reported between 2004 and 2009 was 22, 31 outbreaks were reported between 2010 and 2012, and 29 from 2013 through 2017 <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib07">(7)</link>. In recent years, outbreaks not associated with meat have been reported. In 2014, an outbreak of 99 cases of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection was reported in Utah that were associated with the consumption of raw milk <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Between 2016 and 2019, more than 160 people from across the United States were infected with multidrug-resistant <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> after being exposed to pet store puppies. Exposure to cattle and swine feces increases the risk of acquiring <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>, but the exposure is not always obvious. For example, 22 participants became infected with <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> after being exposed to surface water contaminated with cattle and swine feces during a high-intensity mud race <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib09">(9)</link>. These mud races are often hosted by the U. S. military and located in rural areas where muddy obstacle courses can be constructed.</para>
        <para>Contaminated water is an infrequent vehicle for this infection. There is no evidence of person-to-person spread of this organism. Adequate cooking of poultry and avoidance of cross-contamination of other foods will prevent most <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> cases. The infectious dose for this organism appears to be intermediate between those for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp. (low) and <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp. (high). Like <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp., <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> is an organism that causes disease mainly during the warm-weather months, with a peak incidence in July. One of the interesting observations concerning this organism is that the highest incidence of infection is in infants (&lt;1 year old) and adolescents and young adults (15 to 29 years old). It is the most frequent cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in college students in the United States, with isolation rates on certain campuses as high as 15% in individuals with diarrhea. In the adolescent and young adult age group, infections are more common in males. It is speculated that these individuals are preparing the bulk of their meals for the first time in their lives and may not practice the best food preparation hygiene.</para>
        <para>To prevent <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection, the CDC recommends washing hands thoroughly before and after food preparation, keeping raw poultry away from other foods and using separate cutting boards for raw meat, cooking food thoroughly before consuming, not consuming raw milk, not drinking untreated water, and practicing healthy habits with pets <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Animals and animal products are the primary source of infection for Campylobacter <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib11">(11)</link>. “Factory farming,” in which large numbers of animals are grown in close quarters, results in high colonization rates with this organism. For example, cattle “finished” on feedlots have a much higher colonization rate than grazing animals. Essentially all chickens raised in commercial chicken barns, which can hold as many as 100,000 animals, are colonized with <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>by the fourth week of life. Studies have shown that contamination of poultry carcasses can increase significantly during automated processing. Agricultural research is focusing on ways to reduce or prevent contamination during processing. For example, research from 2021 performed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture used CDC FoodNet surveillance data to assess the roles of food, season, temperature, and geographic location in <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib12">(12)</link>. The findings from this study suggest that foods other than poultry may play a greater role in campylobacteriosis than previously thought and that regional differences in sporadic <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection persist even after controlling for season, temperature, and food purchasing patterns.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Two classes of antimicrobials are used to treat <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infections: macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Resistance to the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin has been increasing over the years, and in the United States, a 2023 study estimates demonstrated resistance rates just above 29% <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib13">(13)</link>. In some countries, the use of a fluoroquinolone is no longer an effective treatment option <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Currently, the rate of macrolide resistance in the United States remains low. Resistance to ciprofloxacin is much more common than resistance to macrolides. The reasons for this difference are multifactorial.</para>
        <para>First, a single mutation in the DNA gyrase, the target protein for the fluoroquinolones, can result in high-level resistance. In contrast, macrolide resistance usually requires multiple mutations to reach clinical significance, rendering macrolide resistance much less common in animals (&lt;10%) and even less so in humans. Second, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants appear more “fit” than macrolide-resistant ones. This is significant because in the early part of this century, “animal use only” fluoroquinolones such as enrofloxacin were widely used to prevent bacterial respiratory infections in large chicken houses that contained as many as 30,000 birds. The use of fluoroquinolones in these birds resulted in the selection of mutant strains of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> that were not only resistant to the “animal use only” fluoroquinolones but also had cross-resistance to the human ones. The overcrowded chicken houses also resulted in the colonization of large percentages of animals with these resistant organisms. Although enrofloxacin has been banned for use in poultry in the United States, the fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms have persisted due to superior fitness. Additionally, high rates of fluoroquinolone resistance have been noted in <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>  isolates from feedlot cattle in the United States, with resistance rates reaching 35.4% in <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> and 74.4% in <emphasis>C. coli</emphasis><emphasis role="strong"><emphasis> </emphasis></emphasis><link linkend="ch0024s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Due to the mutable nature of <emphasis>Campylobacter,</emphasis> the use of fluoroquinolones in cattle production, and the acquisition of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection in humans from food animal consumption, scientists emphasize the importance of preventing the development and dissemination of fluoroquinolone-resistant <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infections.</para>
        <para>Ciprofloxacin is frequently prescribed for travelers to low- and middle-income countries, to be taken if they develop diarrhea. This is done because ciprofloxacin is active against many bacterial pathogens they may encounter. Unfortunately, ciprofloxacin resistance is increasing not only in <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> but also in <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, calling into question the durability of this approach.</para>
        <para>To respond to the threat of antibiotic-resistant <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>, the CDC continues to track changes in antibiotic resistance seen in clinical isolates and to enhance surveillance through advanced technological approaches like whole-genome sequencing of isolates obtained from people, meat, and food animals. Many new and non-antibiotic approaches to controlling <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> have been proposed and are undergoing research and include prebiotics, probiotics, fatty acids, bacteriocin, bacteriophages, immunization, and antibiotic adjuvants.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Like <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> spp., this organism rarely causes bacteremia in the immunocompetent host <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The most likely reason is that this organism, unlike <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis> spp., does not survive within phagocytic cells. It is either locally ingested and killed by phagocytes in the intestinal wall or carried by lymphatic drainage to the Peyer’s patches, where it is killed. Occasional cases of <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> bacteremia occur, but most are transient because the reticuloendothelial system can eliminate this organism from the bloodstream.</para>
        <para><emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>-associated diarrhea and bacteremia are much more common in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have CD4 counts of &lt;200/μl. However, with the widespread use of combined antiretroviral therapy in high-income countries, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> bacteremia has declined dramatically in this patient population. In addition to individuals living with HIV, those at higher risk of more severe disease include patients with hypo- or agammaglobulinemia or those who have defects in humoral immunity. In these patients, gastrointestinal illness is frequently accompanied by bacteremia. While bacteremia caused by <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> is rare, it is an important condition for the medical microbiologist to be aware of. Due to their small size and Gram-negative staining reaction, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> organisms may be difficult to visualize on a positive blood culture Gram stain. Blood cultures that repeatedly flag positive with no organism seen in the Gram stain should always be investigated further, for example, with the fluorescent acridine orange stain, to visualize structures that were missed on the Gram stain (<link linkend="ch0024s0001fg03">Fig. 21.3</link>). If curved rods are seen on a follow-up stain and the patient has a history of gastrointestinal illness, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> should be considered.</para>
        <para><emphasis>C. fetus</emphasis> rather than <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> is the species of <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> most likely to cause bacteremia.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>   Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by acute flaccid paralysis in which patients become either hyporeflexic or areflexic <link linkend="ch0024s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Patients require intubation in ~25% of cases, and secondary pneumonia is an important contributor to its 5% mortality rate. Guillain-Barré syndrome can have multiple antecedents that typically occur 3 to 6 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. It is estimated that 30% of these episodes are associated with <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> diarrhea and that it occurs after 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,000 <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> infections.</para>
        <para>The disease is thought to be a result of molecular mimicry, in which antibodies targeted against the lipooligosaccharide of <emphasis>C. jejuni</emphasis> cross-react with peripheral nerve ganglioside, resulting in an acute inflammatory polyneuropathy. Two treatment strategies have been developed. One uses plasma exchange to remove antibodies and complement, which mediates this inflammatory neuropathy. The other uses immunoglobulin to bind the autoantibodies produced in response to the <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> infection or inhibit the activation of complement by autoantibody.</para>
        <para>Other autoimmune syndromes associated with <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> are reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome), the major manifestation being inflammation of either the urethra or conjunctiva, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> may also be responsible for flares of inflammatory bowel disease. This organism, as well as other diarrheal pathogens, has also been associated with irritable bowel syndrome. As we unravel the role of the intestinal microbiota in inflammatory and irritable bowel disease, we are likely to develop a better understanding of the role of these bacteria in these disease processes.</para>
