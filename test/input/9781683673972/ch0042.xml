        <para>This patient’s lesion is best described as a large, expanding plaque with a targetoid appearance. This appearance is referred to as erythema migrans, a classic appearing Lyme disease rash<link linkend="ch0042s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Spiders, mites, and ticks are the arachnids she would most likely encounter in tall grass. Spiders are not known to transmit infections, and while certain species of mites can transmit <emphasis>Orientia tsutsugamushi</emphasis>, the cause of scrub typhus, they are not found in the United States. This leaves ticks as the major arachnid exposure of concern when considering infectious causes of a rash.</para>
        <para>Bacterial, viral, and parasitic tick-borne diseases exist in the United States<link linkend="ch0042s0002bib01">(4)</link>. The most common in this patient’s geographic region include Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, hard tick relapsing fever (<emphasis>Borrelia miyamotoi</emphasis> disease), and encephalitis due to Powassan virus. Additional tick-borne diseases include ehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis, tularemia, Heartland virus disease, and Bourbon virus disease, but these are not common in her geographical region <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Her symptom of a nonspecific fever is consistent with Lyme disease, but it is the presence of the characteristic erythematous annular rash, referred to as erythema migrans, demonstrated in <link linkend="ch0042s0004fg01">Fig. 39.1</link>, that is diagnostic. The rash typically has a target-like appearance with expanding borders. Some patients will have these lesions at multiple sites. This patient had one rather prominent lesion.</para>
        <para>Lyme disease is caused by a number of related organisms in the bacteria species complex <emphasis>Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato</emphasis> (Bbsl) <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib06">(6)</link>. More than 20 species of <emphasis>Borrelia</emphasis> cause Lyme disease and comprise Bbsl. In the United States, <emphasis>Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto</emphasis>, henceforth referred to as <emphasis>B. burgdorferi</emphasis>, is the genospecies responsible for nearly all Lyme disease cases, with rare cases reported due to <emphasis>Borrelia mayonii</emphasis>. In Europe and Asia, <emphasis>Borrelia afzelii</emphasis> and <emphasis>Borrelia garinii</emphasis> are the predominant Lyme disease-causing species.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The patient lives in Connecticut, a state with a very high incidence of Lyme disease <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib07">(7)</link>. In fact, the disease was initially described in (and named for) Old Lyme, a town in Connecticut. Other regions where Lyme disease is endemic include other areas in the northeastern United States, Minnesota, Wisconsin, northern California, and much of Europe, particularly between 35° north latitude and 60° north latitude. Regions of endemicity are expanding, particularly to the north, as climate change increases the range of areas inhabitable by Lyme disease-transmitting ticks <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib08">(8)</link>.</para>
        <para><emphasis>B. burgdorferi</emphasis> is spread to humans by ticks of the genus <emphasis>Ixodes</emphasis>. In the northeastern United States, the white-footed mouse appears to be the primary reservoir of <emphasis>B. burgdorferi</emphasis>, which is present in the mouse’s bloodstream. This mouse is also the preferred host for the <emphasis>Ixodes scapularis</emphasis> tick, the principal vector of this spirochete. On the west coast of the United States, <emphasis>Ixodes pacificus</emphasis> is the primary vector, while <emphasis>Ixodes ricinus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ixodes persulcatus</emphasis> are the predominant vectors in Europe and Asia.</para>
        <para>Given that the patient was walking through tall grass, the environment where ticks are likely to be found, she may have had an ixodid tick attached to her during this time. Ticks are frequently found in woody areas, but also can be found in grassy areas. All three stages in the life cycle of the tick, i. e., larva, nymph, and adult, can feed on a human host, but only the nymph and adult stages can transmit the disease. Larval stage ticks do not carry <emphasis>Borrelia</emphasis> spirochetes, as this organism is not transmitted transovarially (from adult female to offspring), and therefore cannot transmit the infection during their larval-stage blood meal. However, larvae and nymphs can become infected after feeding on a <emphasis>B. burgdorferi</emphasis>-infected mouse (or other small mammal), maintain the organism via transstadial transmission (across life cycle stages), and pass the organism to humans during the subsequent blood meals as nymphs and adults. Transfer of the spirochetes from the infected <emphasis>I. scapularis</emphasis> ticks to humans appears to require 36 to 48 hours of attachment. The events that occur in the tick during the attachment are complex, with the spirochetes migrating from the gut to the salivary glands. Additionally, the organism must express a protein called outer surface protein C that enhances infectivity of the spirochete for the human host. It is believed that this migration and phenotypic change explain the need for prolonged attachment prior to transmission. Ticks removed before the 36 to 48 hours probably do not transmit the spirochete. However, the nymph stage of the tick is extremely small (described as the size of a pencil point), so the tick may go unnoticed. Less than half of patients with documented Lyme disease can recall a tick bite.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Erythema migrans is absent in roughly 20 to 30% of Lyme disease infections <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Without this characteristic rash, laboratory testing can assist with diagnosis. Testing for Lyme disease includes both direct and indirect detection methods <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib10">(10)</link>. The role of direct detection methods, namely Bbsl NAAT, is limited. The best performance is seen with synovial fluid from cases of Lyme arthritis. Sensitivity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood is substantially lower, equating to low negative predictive value, particularly in cases of high clinical suspicion. Indirect detection, including a two-step algorithmic approach to antibody detection, is the mainstay of laboratory diagnosis. For decades, the standard two-tiered testing (STTT) approach included an initial screening enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) or an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Positive or equivocal specimens were then directed to the more specific IgG and IgM Western blot or immunoblot for confirmation. In 2019, with the FDA clearance of new EIAs, the MTTT algorithm was introduced <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib11">(11</link>, <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib12">12)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The MTTT consists of successive EIAs, combining either whole-cell sonicate (WCS), recombinant VlsE, or recombinant C6 peptide. The specific assays used in the two-step algorithm may vary, but it is recommended that they differ antigenically to reduce the likelihood of shared false positivity. Additionally, the assays may be polyvalent (total antibody) or separate monovalent IgG and IgM antibody assays. The two-tiered testing can be arranged in many combinations as long as the assays are FDA-cleared for inclusion in an MTTT protocol. As an example, a polyvalent VlsE EIA may be performed first. Positive or equivocal samples will proceed to a second-tier test, a polyvalent WCS EIA. <link linkend="ch0042s0001fg02">Figure 39.2</link> outlines suggested MTTT algorithms as defined by CDC and Association of Public Health Laboratories. The MTTT algorithm provides a few benefits when compared to the STTT, including reduced cost and greater sensitivity in the acute phase of infection, although room for improvement remains <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib13">(13)</link>. While improved serologic assays may boost sensitivity and specificity to some degree, reliance on antibody production is a constant limitation for acute phase detection that enhanced direct detection methods could address.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Approximately 90% of patients with <emphasis>B. burgdorferi</emphasis> present as this patient did with fever and skin rash and respond to antimicrobial therapy with no sequelae. Left untreated, <emphasis>Borrelia</emphasis> can disseminate to multiple organs, causing further complications <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Early disseminated disease can include Lyme neuroborreliosis with a clinical picture of headache, CSF with a lymphocytic pleocytosis, cranial nerve VII palsy, peripheral neuropathy, meningoencephalitis, and subacute encephalopathy. Acute Lyme carditis can also occur in about 5% of patients. In untreated late Lyme disease, Lyme arthritis is the most common manifestation. Arthritis generally appears months to years after initial infection and most commonly involves the knee.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Joint guidelines for the treatment of Lyme disease from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) were updated in 2021 <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 10 days, is the preferred regimen. This strategy has the advantage of being active against other tick-borne bacteria that may cause coinfection. Historically, doxycycline was avoided in the treatment of children. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics now endorses the use of doxycycline as the preferred regimen in children <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Alternative regimens include amoxicillin and cefuroxime depending on complicating Lyme disease manifestations and patient factors that may be contraindications for use of doxycycline (e. g., pregnancy).</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  A subset of patients who have been effectively treated for Lyme disease experience prolonged symptoms, including fatigue, pain, and cognitive deficits. This phenomenon is referred to as PTLDS, a more appropriate descriptor than chronic Lyme disease, as there is no evidence that the bacterium persists in these patients <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib17">(17)</link>. The cause of PTLDS is unknown and challenging to differentiate from other chronic conditions with similar symptoms, making this entity frustrating to both patients and clinicians.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>   With respect to patients experiencing PTLDS, there is little rationale for additional diagnostic testing. Serology testing is not informative, as antibodies persist after initial infection. The presence of antibodies does not provide any information about persistence versus clearance of infection. Serology should not be trended as a marker of successful treatment.</para>
        <para>There is also controversy about diagnostic testing to be performed on a tick removed from a patient. However, the AAN/ACR/IDSA guidelines clearly recommend against such testing on the basis of the results not being informative of infection. The presence or absence of <emphasis>Borrelia</emphasis> DNA in the tick does not equate to likelihood of infection. The guidelines do, however, support identification of the type of tick, as this information can be used to counsel the patient on the types of infections they are at risk of acquiring and the symptoms to be aware of.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  Prevention of Lyme disease is similar to the prevention of other tick-borne diseases <link linkend="ch0042s0002bib18">(18)</link>. In areas of endemicity, the use of appropriate clothing, including long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and closed-toe shoes, is important when exposure to ticks may occur. The use of tick repellents, including the chemical <emphasis>N, N</emphasis>-diethyl-<emphasis>m</emphasis>-toluamide (DEET) on skin and clothing and permethrin on clothing, is an additional precaution. Finally, examination of the skin after walking in an environment in which tick exposure is a possibility allows for the removal of ticks before they are able to transmit <emphasis>B. burgdorferi</emphasis>.</para>
