This patient was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, which was managed with a lumpectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation. Two years later, she was diagnosed with glioblastoma, which was treated with radiotherapy, bevacizumab, and temozolomide. The patient had multiple adverse effects from treatment, including aplastic anemia, and was started on isotretinoin. In addition to adverse drug reactions, the patient developed <emphasis>Leptotrichia</emphasis> bacteremia.</para>

      <para>Since there were concerns for disseminated infection and the ophthalmology/ear, nose, and throat (ENT) evaluation determined the patient’s vision and sinus exams were concerning, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the sinus with contrast and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were ordered. The CT scan showed hyperdense secretions within the right and left maxillary sinuses greater than in the right bilateral ethmoid sinuses. The radiologists concluded that the findings could represent inspissated secretions versus fungal sinusitis. The brain MRI did not show any evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis. Due to the possibility of invasive fungal sinusitis, the patient underwent a sinus endoscopy. During the procedure, sinus necrosis was noted, and the tissue was debrided and sent for histopathology.</para>
      <para>The fungal culture results and pathology from the specimens collected during the sinus endoscopy were also positive for <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis>. The option of surgical debridement for source control was discussed with the ENT team. Due to the extent of the infection, her advanced glioblastoma, and limited treatment options, the team opted not to perform surgery and continued to treat her infection with amphotericin B and voriconazole. A CT scan showed a hyperattenuating lesion around the pons, suggesting possible bleeding. The patient continued to deteriorate and was discharged to inpatient hospice care where she subsequently passed away.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Leptotrichia</emphasis> species are anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli that are commensal organisms in the human gastrointestinal, oropharyngeal, and female genital tracts <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This organism is primarily an opportunistic pathogen in patients with immunosuppression, including those with hematologic malignancy and associated neutropenia, patients who have had a stem cell transplant, and patients receiving chemotherapy. It is possible that the therapy this patient received for her malignancies led to significant neutropenia, putting her at risk of bacteremia caused by <emphasis>Leptotrichia</emphasis> species. This patient’s clinical team suspected that the bacteria translocated from her gastrointestinal tract into her bloodstream.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Immunocompromised patients are at an increased risk of various types of infections. Given the patient’s history of severe neutropenia and immunosuppression, in addition to tender plaques disseminated across much of her body, the dermatologist suspected invasive fungal disease. While invasive fungal disease is relatively rare in immunocompetent hosts, it is more common in immunosuppressed patients, particularly those with prolonged neutropenia <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Low neutrophils increase a person’s risk of acquiring infections, particularly with opportunistic pathogens that can cause severe disease. Some species of fungi are intrinsically resistant to antifungal agents that are used as prophylaxis given to patients at high risk of fungal disease, such as stem cell transplant recipients or those receiving chemotherapy. For example, <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> is resistant to many classes of antifungals, including some of the azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib03">(3)</link>. These factors, paired with the chronic nature of the patient’s presentation, suggest invasive fungal disease as a possible cause. Opportunistic fungal infections that can cause dermatologic manifestations include <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>, <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>, <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis>, the <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The organism seen in the microscopy of the patient’s positive blood culture and culture tape prep is clearly fungal (<link linkend="ch0067s0001fg03">Fig. 64.2</link> and <link linkend="ch0067s0001fg03">64.3</link>). In <link linkend="ch0067s0001fg03">Fig. 64.2</link>, there are microconidia and macroconidia present, but the macroconidia have a characteristic banana or canoe-shaped appearance. These are highly suggestive of <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species. The macroconidia of <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> are often two or more celled, thick-walled, and smooth. Additionally, the macroconidia each have a distinctive foot cell and pointed distal ends, lending to the canoe shape. Microconidia are smaller and typically one-celled. They are ovoid or cylindrical in shape and often arranged in balls. Positive blood cultures in patients with invasive fungal diseases are unusual in large part because most invasive fungal infections are caused by <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>. Because <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> invades endothelial cells, it rarely causes fungemia even in those patients who have <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> endocarditis proven at autopsy (where this diagnosis is frequently made). On the other hand, positive blood cultures are found in ~50% of patients with disseminated <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> infections. The reason for this is that <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> produces a “yeast-like” cell when it invades tissue, which can enter the bloodstream and disseminate the organism. Because the sensitivity of blood cultures is only 50% in invasive <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> disease and blood cultures are rarely positive with invasive aspergillosis, the finding of a negative culture does not rule out disseminated fungal infections.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> is an environmental pathogen that causes disease in plants and animals <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib05">(5)</link>. The extent of disease in humans varies based on immune status and host response but can span from superficial to fatal disseminated disease. The most implicated species in human disease is <emphasis>Fusarium solani</emphasis>, although 12 or more other species have been reported. In immunocompetent hosts, the most common types of infection are keratitis and onychomycosis (infection of the toe or fingernails), with larger outbreaks of <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> keratitis occurring in contact lens wearers. In immunosuppressed hosts, disseminated disease is much more common, especially in those who have received stem cell or solid organ transplants. <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species are unique compared to other molds in that they produce yeastlike structures that help them grow and disseminate in the blood. The portal of entry for <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> is the airways, although entry can also occur at the site of tissue breakdown on the skin or mucosal surfaces. <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> is ubiquitous in the environment, so exposure may occur via inhalation of conidia in the air or contact with contaminated sources such as showers or faucets. Inhalation of conidia may lead to sinusitis, which is always considered invasive in immunosuppressed patients. Approximately 18% of patients with fusariosis have sinus involvement <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Skin lesions can indicate disseminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The lesions are typically papular or nodular and painful.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> is a septated, hyaline mold. In tissue, it cannot be readily distinguished from <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> or other hyaline molds, but it can be distinguished from <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis>, whose hyphal elements in tissue tend to be broader, ribbon-like, and pauciseptate. <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> is identified in <link linkend="ch0067s0001fg03">Fig. 64.2</link> and <link linkend="ch0067s0001fg03">Fig. 64.3</link> by its very characteristic banana-shaped, multicellular macroconidia. Fusariosis diagnosis relies heavily on histopathology, recommended by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology/European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECMM/ESCMID) guidelines <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Hyphae of <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> in tissue resemble those of <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>, with septate filaments that dichotomize in acute angles. The macroscopic features of <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> include wooly or cottony spreading colonies (<link linkend="ch0067s0001fg03">Fig. 64.4</link>). The color of the colonies may vary between white cream, tan, salmon, cinnamon, yellow, red, pink, or purple. Immunohistochemistry and <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> hybridization offer alternate techniques, with immunohistochemistry providing rapid results but limited commercial antibodies for <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> detection. While morphology-based identification is still one of the most common identification methods used in clinical laboratories, it is challenged by a lack of specificity as <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species often form complex colonies and share characteristics with other fungi like <emphasis>Acremonium</emphasis>. Although less common in clinical mycology, nucleic acid amplification-based tools are effective in identifying <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species, requiring the isolation of sufficient pure fungal DNA. Various nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) targeting intergenic spacer regions distinguish different <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species complexes. NAATs exhibit high sensitivity, particularly for <emphasis>F. solani</emphasis> species complex detection. Currently, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is seen as the best method for identifying <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> isolates at the species level. Finally, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been demonstrated as an efficient option for identifying invasive fungi, including <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis>, which can be identified to the species level with good performance (<link linkend="ch0067s0002bib07">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib08">8</link>).</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Multiple factors, including an absence of interpretive breakpoints and species-specific resistance profiles, challenge susceptibility testing of <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis>. <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species do not have a normal MIC distribution or minimum effective concentration distribution, making it difficult to establish a breakpoint <link linkend="ch0067s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Furthermore, since many laboratories do not routinely perform susceptibility testing on <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species, the epidemiology of resistant infections is largely unknown. This patient was being empirically treated with micafungin, but dissemination of this organism occurred despite the use of micafungin prophylaxis. This is not surprising, because <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> is intrinsically resistant to echinocandins such as micafungin. Micafungin is recommended as a prophylactic agent to prevent the two most common agents of invasive fungal infections in this patient population, <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>spp. Susceptibility testing should be performed, particularly in high-risk immunosuppressed patients, to help guide therapy selection and clinical management. However, since the probabilities of clinical success are uncertain for many drug-species combinations, results should be interpreted with caution. As was used in this patient, combination therapy (e. g., voriconazole and amphotericin B) is commonly used in patients with disseminated disease<link linkend="ch0067s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para>It is important to note that there are ESCMID/ECMM guidelines for the recommended management of disseminated fusariosis, but there is no optimal treatment regimen<link linkend="ch0067s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Voriconazole is considered first-line treatment and is often combined with another antifungal such as amphotericin B. Surgical debridement is strongly recommended in addition to antifungal therapy and the removal of venous catheters. Postponing any therapy that induced neutropenia should be considered, if feasible.</para>
