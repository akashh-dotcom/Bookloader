        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea. In infectious keratitis, there is destruction of the corneal epithelium and stroma. There are three common forms of keratitis: (i) cases associated with contact lens use; (ii) keratitis following trauma, including postsurgical infections; and (iii) viral keratitis. Bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses can all cause infectious keratitis <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib01">(1)</link>, with the likelihood depending on the level of immunosuppression of the patient and the mode of exposure.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Bacterial:</emphasis> <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>; coagulase-negative staphylococci; streptococci, including <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci; <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> species; <emphasis>Cutibacterium acnes</emphasis>; and <emphasis>Moraxella</emphasis> species are some of the most common bacterial species encountered. For contact lens wearers, Gram-negative bacilli found in water, such as <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis> and <emphasis>Serratia marcescens</emphasis>, are more likely. In postsurgical keratitis, rapidly growing mycobacteria are also causes of infectious keratitis, also linked to water exposure.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Fungal:</emphasis> Fungal keratitis can be separated into yeasts and molds. The most common yeasts include <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species and <emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis>. Mold infections are most common following trauma and implantation of fungal spores, with <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Paecilomyces</emphasis> species, and dematiaceous (melanin-producing) molds being the most commonly isolated. <emphasis>Prototheca</emphasis>, an alga, has also been associated with posttrauma keratitis.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Parasitic:</emphasis> For contact lens wearers, the most common predisposing activities for infectious keratitis include (i) practicing poor contact lens hygiene; (ii) replacing contact lens solutions with tap water; and (iii) wearing lenses when showering or when swimming in freshwater, swimming pools, or hot tubs. In addition to some of the waterborne bacteria, poor contact lens hygiene is associated with parasitic keratitis, namely infection with <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis>. Additionally, microsporidia, protozoan parasites related to fungi, are a post-trauma cause.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Viral:</emphasis>A large number of viruses have been implicated in keratitis, depending on the patient’s level of immunosuppression and mode of infection (i. e., hematogenous or direct inoculation). The most common causes include the herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The arrows in <link linkend="ch0070s0004fg01">Fig. 67.1</link> are pointing to trophozoites of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> is a free-living ameba. Prolonged contact of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> with the eyes, usually through poor contact lens cleaning or swimming with contact lenses, can result in <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The diagnosis can be made from surgical pathology from a corneal biopsy, visualizing cysts or trophozoites in the infected tissue. For <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis>, specialized culture can be performed. Briefly, tissue is minced in Page’s ameba saline, which notably has lower concentrations of sodium chloride than physiologic or phosphate-buffered saline <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib02">(2)</link>. A small amount of this homogenate is added to an agar plate growing <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis> or <emphasis>Klebsiella aerogenes</emphasis> (a bacterial food source for the amebae). The inoculated agar plate is observed daily for 1 week under ×100 magnification looking for presence of amebae. These cultures are time-consuming, require specialized media that may not be readily available near the patient, require technical expertise, and carry significant risk of contamination. More recently, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for detection of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> has become the preferred diagnostic method <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib03">(3)</link>. NAAT can be performed from a corneal biopsy, paraffin-embedded tissue, corneal scraping, corneal swab, and in some cases contact lenses or lens case. Testing is available at major reference laboratories and offers an opportunity for simplified diagnostic workup.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> species are found throughout the world <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib04">(4)</link>. They are found in water and soil, in both natural and man-made environments (e. g., heating/cooling units and household plumbing)<link linkend="ch0070s0002bib05">(5)</link>. <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> exists in the environment in both cyst and trophozoite forms. While the trophozoite is the infectious form, inoculation with cysts can also result in infection through conversion to the trophozoite form within the host. <link linkend="ch0070s0001fg02">Figure 67.2</link> depicts the life cycle of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> and modes of infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Treatment of <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis is challenging, and delayed diagnosis can contribute to poor clearance of the organisms as cysts in the tissue are highly resistant to therapy and can result in relapsed disease (<link linkend="ch0070s0002bib02">2</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib06">6</link>). First-line therapy can include a combination of PHMB and chlorhexidine. Recent evidence has shown that the addition of oral miltefosine can assist in clearance in treatment-refractory cases <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Infections with free-living amebae are relatively uncommon <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib05">(5)</link>. In addition to <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> species, <emphasis>Balamuthia mandrillaris</emphasis> and <emphasis>Naegleria fowleri</emphasis> cause human infections. Shared traits among these organisms include their global distribution, soil and water environmental habitats, and presence of both cyst and trophozoite stages in nature (<emphasis>Naegleria</emphasis> has a third flagellate stage as well).</para>
        <para>Inoculation with <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> and <emphasis>Balamuthia</emphasis> can occur through the upper airway or breaks in the skin. Hematogenous spread of these organisms can reach the central nervous system, resulting in a slowly progressive neurologic disease termed granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE). Clinical manifestations of these organisms, including GAE, are most common in immunocompromised individuals. Diagnostic options for GAE are similar to <emphasis>Acanthamoeba</emphasis> keratitis, including surgical pathology, culture, or NAAT from tissue. NAAT can also be performed on cerebrospinal fluid. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), from cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, has also shown the ability to detect these free-living amebae (<link linkend="ch0070s0002bib07">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib08">8</link>).</para>

        <para>In contrast, infection with <emphasis>N. fowleri</emphasis> causes the rapidly progressive primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which is nearly always fatal and has no predilection for immunocompromised individuals <link linkend="ch0070s0002bib09">(9)</link>. PAM occurs when ameba-containing water contacts the nasal mucosa, usually through improper sinus irrigation or swimming in warm, stagnant, or improperly chlorinated water. Trophozoites can migrate up the olfactory nerves and into the brain. Diagnostic options for <emphasis>Naegleria</emphasis> include the previously mentioned culture, NAAT, mNGS, and histopathology. Notably, only trophozoites, no cysts, are present in tissue with <emphasis>Naegleria</emphasis>. In suspected cases of PAM, direct mounts of cerebrospinal fluid can be used to detect the motile trophozoites.</para>
