Her mother also reported that her daughter had been “spitting up” more than usual and had episodes of tachypnea. A review of systems was notable only for a nonproductive cough. Her pulse was 168 beats/minute, her respiratory rate was 32 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation was 92 to 95% on room air. Her complete blood count was significant for a white blood cell count of 15,300 cells/μl with an absolute lymphocyte count of 10,900 cells/μl. The mother had a chronic cough of 4 weeks’ duration but had been afebrile. Six weeks before this patient’s admission, her 10-year-old brother also had a prolonged coughing illness that responded to breathing treatments and inhaled steroids.</para>

      <para>After initial examination and a negative molecular respiratory viral panel (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), the child was admitted to the hospital. Her initial hospital course was uneventful, and she was discharged after 2 days. However, she was readmitted the following day with worsening respiratory symptoms. Over the next several days, during coughing episodes, she had increasing difficulty breathing, tachypnea up to 100 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation in the low 80s. She was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for respiratory support. Upon admission to the PICU, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and sent for molecular multiplex respiratory testing that included viruses and bacteria. The test was positive for <emphasis>Bordetella pertussis</emphasis>.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Cough is one of the most common complaints patients present with in the primary care setting, and the differential is broad. Acute coughs are considered episodes of coughing that last less than 3 weeks <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib01">(1)</link>. In most cases, the cause of coughing in children is common respiratory viruses (e. g., the common cold) and can last up to 14 days. Bronchiolitis, which is most commonly caused by RSV, is inflammation of the bronchioles and results in coughing, tachypnea, and sometimes wheezing<link linkend="ch0012s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Depending on the time of year a child presents with respiratory symptoms, RSV should be high on the differential, particularly if the child is younger in age (see <ulink url="ch0014.xml#ch0014">case 11</ulink>). RSV is responsible for approximately 15% of pediatric primary care visits, and 2–3% of children with RSV will be hospitalized <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Other less common causes of pediatric coughing include inhalation of a foreign object, asthma, rhinosinusitis, or infection with <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis>. In the early stages of disease, <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> infection (also known as whooping cough) resembles a common cold. However, as the disease progresses the coughing fits can become severe, presenting with a characteristic “whooping” sound that occurs during an inhale between coughing episodes. Most cough diagnoses are made based on a clinical evaluation and history alone, and because most cases are caused by common respiratory viruses, antibiotics are not needed <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib04">(4)</link>. However, testing for viral or bacterial pathogens for which there is available therapy may be appropriate (e. g., influenza viruses,<emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis>, SARS-CoV-2), or may help provide better guidance for monitoring disease progress and ensuring appropriate action is taken if the patient declines clinically (e. g., RSV bronchiolitis). The use of rapid molecular multiplex respiratory tests at the point of care is evolving, but data for use in pediatric patients in primary care are limited. In the hospital setting, studies have demonstrated a faster turnaround time, more comprehensive pathogen detection, and improvements in appropriate antiviral prescribing (e. g., timely administration of antiviral for influenza) and infection control measures<link linkend="ch0012s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Given the patient’s age and risk of more severe disease with RSV, it would be appropriate to order respiratory testing that included RSV.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The patient was infected with <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis>, the causative agent of whooping cough. <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> is a Gram-negative bacterium that is highly contagious and transmitted directly from human to human via the respiratory route <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib06">(6)</link>. With classic whooping cough, children have paroxysmal coughing, which is a series of coughs during a single expiration. Paroxysms are often accompanied by a “whoop” sound in children due to rapid inspiration through a narrow trachea. (An audio file of a child with pertussis can be found at <ulink url="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/multimedia/audio/whooping_cough_classic_whoop">https://www. merckmanuals. com/professional/multimedia/audio/whooping_cough_classic_whoop</ulink>.) Because of repetitive coughing and resulting disruption of breathing, children will have abnormal oxygen exchange and often turn red and sometimes blue. The repetitive coughing may also result in vomiting or choking on respiratory secretions. Although the classic “whooping” sound was not described for this child, she did have bouts of coughing, leading to increased respiration, decreased oxygenation, and posttussive vomiting. Apnea is more common in infants &lt;6 months old than whooping inspirations. Further, the patient had a lymphocytosis, which is commonly seen in pertussis. Although the etiologic agent is a bacterium, the disease is toxin-mediated, explaining the rise in lymphocyte count. The pertussis toxin (a key virulence factor of <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis>) has been described as the “lymphocytosis-promoting factor.” Clinically, lymphocytosis, often as high as 70 to 80%, is routinely seen in patients with pertussis and is a distinguishing characteristic of this infection.</para>
        <para><emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> is endemic in the United States and is responsible for cyclic epidemics over time. Notably, recent studies of surveillance data demonstrate that while incidence has been cyclical over the last decade, the overall incidence has increased significantly over time. In 2012, there were over 48,000 reported <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> cases, which was the highest number of reported cases since the 1950s <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib07">(7)</link>. In 2023, there were 2,415 cases reported, and by week 27 of 2024, there were nearly 8,000 cases reported <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Across all years, the incidence of disease remains the highest in children under 1 year, and they are the cohort most likely to be hospitalized due to their illness. The noted increased incidence of disease is believed to be due to various factors including the increased use of sensitive diagnostic technologies, improved surveillance and awareness, and waning of vaccine immunity.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> specifically binds to ciliated epithelial cells. This binding is mediated primarily by filamentous hemagglutinin, an important virulence factor of this organism. Since the nasopharynx is lined with ciliated epithelial cells, it is the most sensitive site for detecting <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis>. Culture has long been the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of pertussis owing to its superior specificity (~100%). However, there are many disadvantages to <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> culture. First, the organism is very labile outside of the host. Second, it must be cultivated on specialized media such as Bordet-Gengou or Regan-Lowe agar. These attributes make the bacterium difficult to isolate. Third, it generally takes 7 to 10 days to isolate and identify <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> from culture. In <link linkend="ch0012s0001fg01">Fig. 9.1</link>, we see an isolate of <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> that grew after 7 days of incubation on a charcoal-containing medium, Regan-Lowe agar. In outbreak settings where <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> can be rapidly spread from person to person, culture is too slow. Lastly, the clinical course of pertussis is complex, and the organism is generally only recovered during the first 2 weeks of illness.</para>

        <para>The sensitivity of culture during the first 2 weeks of pertussis is 30 to 60%, dropping dramatically (1 to 3%) by the third week of illness. The sensitivity of culture is also negatively affected by antibiotic administration and prior vaccination. Nonetheless, the CDC recommends culturing of nasopharyngeal specimens during an outbreak so that specificity is preserved and isolates are obtained for susceptibility testing and epidemiologic studies<link linkend="ch0012s0002bib09">(9)</link>. For many years, direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) for <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> was done. This assay takes ~2 hours, versus 7 to 10 days for culture, but it has a sensitivity of only 50 to 65%, and false-positive results may occur, especially when laboratorians are unaccustomed to reading these DFA smears. DFA is no longer in the CDC’s diagnostic algorithm for pertussis because of these limitations.</para>
        <para>NAAT has become the method of choice for diagnosing pertussis. Because NAAT does not require that the organisms be alive, it is useful when specimens must be transported long distances. NAAT is more rapid than culture, with results often available the same day the specimen was collected. NAAT is more sensitive than culture and has a high negative predictive value. There are several commercial molecular products available for detecting<emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib10">(10)</link>. These include a 22-plex molecular multiplex panel that detects several respiratory viruses and bacteria simultaneously and stand-alone NAAT tests, including PCR, helicase-dependent amplification, and isothermal loop-mediated DNA amplification. Some laboratories use laboratory-developed NAATs for the detection of <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis>. The performance of these tests varies widely. Sensitivity and specificity depend on the target used for amplification, with the most sensitive tests targeting multicopy sequences and the most specific tests detecting multiple targets. The primary concern for NAAT-based diagnosis of pertussis is the risk of false-positive results. False-positive NAAT results have been the subject of “pseudo” pertussis outbreaks linked to cross-reacting <emphasis>Bordetella</emphasis>spp. (e. g.,<emphasis>B. holmesii</emphasis>), laboratory contamination, and environmental contamination at collection. Interestingly, it has been reported that false-positive results can occur when specimens are collected in the same clinic room where pertussis vaccines (some of which contain genomic DNA) are administered <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib11">(11)</link>. The CDC recommends that the interpretation of pertussis NAAT results be done in conjunction with an evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms, as well as consideration of which NAAT targets are used on the assay.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The clinical course of pertussis is defined by three stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The catarrhal phase lasts 1 to 2 weeks, but symptoms are often nonspecific and are similar to those of many respiratory viral illnesses (malaise, low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, and mild cough). Laboratory diagnosis is most sensitive at this phase, but laboratory testing (particularly in adolescents and adults) is often not performed. Even though pertussis is a toxin-mediated disease, appropriate antimicrobial therapy during the catarrhal stage decreases the organism load, thereby reducing the patient’s infectiousness, the duration and severity of symptoms, and the transmission rate. The paroxysmal phase is characterized by a paroxysmal cough, excessive mucus production, posttussive vomiting, and lymphocytosis that may last up to 6 weeks. This is the stage at which most children, adolescents, and adults are likely to seek medical attention and receive antimicrobial therapy. The damage that the <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> cytotoxin causes—ciliostasis and death of the tracheal epithelial cells—is not reversed by administering an antibiotic. Thus, the cough persists. The last phase is the convalescent phase, characterized by a chronic cough that may last weeks to months. As with the paroxysmal phase, therapy given at this stage is not effective, except for therapy for secondary bacterial pneumonia that develops as a complication.</para>
        <para>Macrolide antibiotics (e. g., azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin) are the drugs of choice for treating pertussis. In addition to a delay in administering antibiotics (as was the case with this child), reasons for lack of response to therapy might include patient noncompliance. Erythromycin, in particular, is often associated with gastrointestinal intolerance. Secondary bacterial pneumonia, an occasional complication of pertussis, must also be considered in patients with persistent cough, particularly if the patient worsens clinically. Finally, the possibility that the organism is resistant to macrolides must be considered. Although macrolide-resistant <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> isolates have been described, susceptibility surveys suggest resistance is still rare in the United States. However, significant rates of macrolide resistance have been reported from clinical pertussis isolates in China, initiating calls for macrolide resistance screening globally <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib12">(12)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> has many virulence factors that mediate attachment to host cells and cause tissue damage <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Pertussis toxin acts as both a secreted toxin and an adhesin, working synergistically with filamentous hemagglutinin. Pertussis toxin belongs to the classic A-B family of ADP-ribosylating toxins (like cholera toxin and Shiga toxin). Additional toxins include adenylate cyclase-hemolysin, a cytotoxin that inhibits chemotaxis and induces apoptosis of macrophages; tracheal cytotoxin, which eliminates mucociliary clearance by ciliostasis and extrusion of ciliated cells and inhibits DNA synthesis; dermonecrotic toxin, which causes dermal necrosis and vasoconstriction; and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, which has proinflammatory activity. Taken together, these pathogenic properties result in a grossly damaged respiratory epithelium with decreased mucociliary clearance, which puts patients at increased risk for secondary pneumonia. Also, this patient required intubation for respiratory support, which further increases the risk of health care-associated pneumonia due to organisms such as methicillin-resistant <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Historically, vaccination against pertussis was recommended at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. This patient was too young to have received any pertussis vaccine. Based on laboratory testing, the mother was confirmed to have pertussis, but the brother could not be confirmed due to the extended time since his illness. Nonetheless, it is probable that the brother also had pertussis. The possibilities are that neither the mother nor the brother was vaccinated against pertussis in childhood or that they were susceptible to infection because the protection offered by the vaccine wanes within 5 to 10 years of administration. In fact, both the mother and brother had been vaccinated in childhood, so the latter possibility is a likely explanation. Another possibility is that these two individuals, closely genetically related, could not mount an immune response to the pertussis vaccine antigens. Studies have shown that vaccine-induced immunity wanes after the fifth dose of pertussis vaccine <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib13">(13)</link>. In this case, the older sibling likely got pertussis from his peers and then infected the mother, who was infectious at the time of the infant’s birth. The infant’s lack of protective immunity, along with the high infectivity of pertussis, made it very likely that the infant would get pertussis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Vaccination against pertussis using a whole-cell vaccine began in the 1940s <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib14">(14)</link>. This vaccine was combined with diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids to make the combination DTP vaccine that was given to infants and toddlers. With widespread immunization, the incidence of pertussis decreased from 157 cases per 100,000 people to &lt;1 per 100,000 in the 1970s (a 157-fold decrease in the pertussis attack rate). However, the whole-cell vaccine contained endotoxin, and it was associated with increased mild side effects such as erythema, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site; fever; drowsiness; and anorexia; as well as severe side effects such as high fever and seizures. Whole-cell vaccines were considered too reactogenic for use in adolescents or adults. Acellular pertussis vaccines, which have fewer side effects, were introduced in the 1990s to replace whole-cell vaccines. These vaccines target the primary virulence factors of <emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> and contain purified proteins, including detoxified pertussis toxins and adhesins.</para>
        <para>The acellular vaccine is combined with DT for the DTaP vaccine given to children in a five-dose series that is completed by age 4 to 6. Neither natural pertussis infection nor vaccine-induced protection provides long-term immunity. Several studies have since shown that the acellular pertussis vaccine is not as effective as the whole-cell vaccine, making children 7 to 10 years old particularly vulnerable as a reservoir of pertussis transmission.</para>
        <para>The CDC reports that reported cases of pertussis have been steadily increasing since the 1980s, leading to a peak in 2012 with 48,277 cases<link linkend="ch0012s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Although reported cases have not been as high as 2012, they have remained elevated until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In 2019, there were &gt;18,000 cases of pertussis reported in the United States and likely many more that were not diagnosed and/or reported. In addition, the number of outbreaks due to pertussis has increased. A well-described outbreak in California occurred in 2010 in which 89% of cases were among infants &lt;6 months old, with the next highest incidences in those 7 to 9 years old and 10 to 18 years old. In 2012, Washington state had &gt;2,500 pertussis cases in 6 months, with the highest incidence in infants &lt;1 year old and children aged 10, 13, and 14 years. In 2012, 49 states reported increases in pertussis cases relative to the previous year.</para>
        <para>Better detection methods (e. g., NAAT) are partially responsible for this increase, but so is natural pertussis epidemiology. It has been estimated that 13 to 20% of adolescents and adults with prolonged cough have pertussis. Diagnosing older individuals with pertussis is problematic because they often have an atypical presentation consisting of nothing more than a chronic cough. However, these individuals are common sources of infant infections, particularly parents, primary caregivers, siblings, and health care personnel. Since infants are at the greatest risk for serious illness and death due to pertussis, these sources of transmission are primary targets for new vaccination strategies.</para>
        <para>In 2005, two tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines, Tdap and DTaP, were approved for administration. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated their recommendations to include these vaccines in 2017<link linkend="ch0012s0002bib16">(16)</link>. The current general recommendations state that children 2 months to 6 years of age should receive five doses of the DTaP vaccine (which contains diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis antigens) at ages 2, 4, 6, and 15 to 18 months and between 4 and 6 years. The first dose of DTaP can be given as early as 6 weeks of age. It is recommended that people between the ages of 11 and 18 years should receive a single dose of Tdap (containing smaller amounts of diphtheria and pertussis components). People 19 years of age or older who have not received a dose of Tdap previously should receive a single dose. ACIP recommends that immunization be a part of all prenatal care and that pregnant women should be vaccinated at between 27 and 36 weeks’ gestation, although it is safe to administer the vaccine at any time during the pregnancy. Finally, all health care personnel should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they have not previously received Tdap. It is hoped that these new vaccination strategies will break the chain of transmission of a pathogen that only infects humans.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Hospitalized patients with pertussis should be on droplet precautions as pertussis is transmitted by large respiratory droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking. Pertussis is highly communicable, with household attack rates of 80 to 100% <link linkend="ch0012s0002bib17">(17)</link>. Droplet precautions should be maintained until the patient has received 5 days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. There is no evidence of fomite transmission, which would also require contact precautions. Close contacts of a person diagnosed with pertussis should be assessed for the infectiousness of the patient (e. g., which stage of disease), the intensity of the exposure, and the risks to the contact of getting pertussis or transmitting it to vulnerable populations (e. g., infants, pregnant women, and health care personnel). If warranted, postexposure prophylaxis with a macrolide should be administered to contacts within 21 days of onset of cough in the index patient. Alternatively, low-risk contacts can be monitored for pertussis symptoms for 21 days.</para>
