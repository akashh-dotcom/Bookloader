      <sect1 id="ch0009s0004"><title>CASE 6</title><para>A 40-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician for a routine annual health exam. She had no concerns beyond stress related to marital problems. She reported regular menstrual cycles every 4 weeks and a normal Papanicolaou (Pap) test history with no record of previous sexually transmitted infections. Her review of systems and pelvic examination were normal. Cervical sampling for a Pap-stained smear and high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA detection was performed. Cytologic examination showed atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASC-US), and the hrHPV molecular detection test was positive. Molecular testing for <emphasis>Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis> was negative.</para>

      <para>Due to her HPV-positive ASC-US result, the patient was referred to a gynecologist for evaluation. During this visit, she stated that she and her husband of 20 years had separated during the last year, and she had a new sexual partner. A colposcopy was performed in which cervical lesions were identified and biopsied. Pathologic examination of the biopsy showed benign endocervical epithelium with acute inflammatory cells; no squamous epithelium was present for evaluation. Since the biopsy showed no evidence of dysplasia or HPV cytopathic effect (CPE), the patient was asked to follow up in 6 to 12 months.</para>
      <para>At 6 months, her physical exam was normal except for presumed bacterial vaginosis. A Pap smear was repeated and showed ASC-US, which was HPV positive. A colposcopy was performed, and lesions were biopsied. Pathologic examination of two biopsies showed squamous and endocervical mucosa present with reactive epithelium changes, but no dysplasia or HPV CPE was identified. Six months later, a repeat Pap was normal and HPV testing was negative, so she was told to return in 1 year.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The ASC-US report indicates that squamous cells displayed abnormalities beyond simple reactive changes but do not meet the criteria for a squamous intraepithelial lesion <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The finding of ASC-US is nonspecific and is relatively common (~4 to 8%) <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Patients with a Pap smear showing ASC-US should be evaluated for HPV infection to determine the appropriate clinical follow-up, as was done for this patient.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, ASCCP (formerly American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology), and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology endorse the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force cervical cancer screening recommendations<link linkend="ch0009s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Women younger than 21 years of age should not be screened by any method, and women 21 to 29 years of age should be screened by cytology alone every 3 years. Primary hrHPV testing may be performed as an alternative to cytology in average-risk patients ≥25 years of age. One of the following is recommended for women 30 to 65 years of age: cytology alone every 3 years, primary hrHPV testing alone every 5 years, or co-testing (hrHPV testing and cytology) every 5 years. Patients with a positive primary hrHPV test should have their specimen reflexed to cytology. Screening can be discontinued in post-hysterectomy patients and after 65 years of age if the woman has an adequate screening history. Screening should occur as above, independent of the woman’s vaccination status. These recommendations do not apply to women who have been diagnosed with high-grade dysplasia or cervical cancer, are immunocompromised, or were exposed to diethylstilbestrol <emphasis>in utero</emphasis>, who need more frequent screening. Diethylstilbestrol is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen that was used in the United States from 1938 to 1971 to prevent miscarriage and other pregnancy complications and is associated with increased reproductive cancers.</para>
        <para>Additional guidelines from ASCCP exist for managing patients with abnormal cytology results and/or a positive HPV test with an emphasis on risk stratification over a single test result<link linkend="ch0009s0002bib04">(4</link>–<link linkend="ch0009s0002bib05">5)</link>. Current guidelines rely on more than the most recent result, including previous screening test results, previous treatments, and other risk factors (i. e., age and immune status). Based on the individual risk for the potential development of cervical cancer, the recommendation may be to repeat the hrHPV test or hrHPV/Pap co-test in 1 or 3 years, get a colposcopy and biopsy, or receive treatment. This new risk-based approach balances the early detection of cervical cell changes and unnecessary testing and treatment.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  FDA-approved tests should be used to detect HPV DNA from liquid cytology specimens <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Available detection chemistries include signal amplification (e. g., hybrid capture) and target amplification (e. g., PCR and transcription-mediated amplification of DNA and RNA, respectively). The initial clinical trials were performed with the hybrid capture system<link linkend="ch0009s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Using CIN 2 (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2) or greater as an endpoint, hybrid capture had a 96% sensitivity (compared to 55% sensitivity of Pap smear). The development of target amplification-based tests has led to an increase in analytic sensitivity but no apparent increase in clinical sensitivity over that observed with non-amplified methods (i. e., hybrid capture). The detection of HPV by molecular screening has reduced cervical cancer rates by providing detection often prior to traditional cytology. Further, a negative HPV test in the setting of ASC-US prevents many unnecessary colposcopies<link linkend="ch0009s0002bib03">(3)</link>.  An additional advantage is the ability to detect only high-risk, or oncogenic, HPV types (e. g., 16, 18, and others), which increases the clinical specificity of HPV detection. Recently approved tests also provide type-level results for HPV 16 and 18, which are responsible for ~70% of cervical cancers and tend to be more aggressive. Women who test positive for type 16 or 18 (even with normal Pap smear) might be referred to colposcopy due to the increased oncogenic potential of these types. One concern with the molecular methods is sample contamination, particularly if liquid cytology specimens are processed via automation. Some versions of automated processors have been shown to cross-contaminate specimens, but more recent automation appears not to have that problem. Nonetheless, to minimize the possibility of laboratory contamination, it is prudent to aliquot from the liquid cytology vial for HPV testing prior to placing the vial on an automated processor. Another concern is that a negative HPV test in a low-risk patient increases the time until the next Pap/HPV test to 5 years. Many physicians are concerned that patients will cease to present for annual health maintenance, which includes screens for many other important women’s health issues, such as breast cancer.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, resulting in ~14 million new infections annually in the United States. Although there are an estimated 79 million HPV infections currently in the United States, about 90% are asymptomatic and resolve within 2 to 3 years with no associated morbidity <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib08">(8)</link>. The peak prevalence for HPV infections is seen in sexually active individuals 15 to 24 years old; this group represents 50% of all new HPV and other sexually transmitted infections. For this reason, it is not recommended that women under 30 years of age be routinely tested for HPV. Most commonly, HPV infection is transient and poses no risk for the development of cancer.</para>
        <para>Given the transient nature of most HPV infections and the nonspecific nature of ASC-US, it was not surprising that the patient had a negative biopsy. Her normal Pap examination and negative HPV test following two colposcopies further supported the negative biopsy results.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>The development of cervical cancer usually takes several years of persistent HPV infection. Thus, the patient’s recent change in sexual partners is likely not the initial source of the HPV infection causing her cervical changes. Disease progression is linked to oncogenic hrHPV types (e. g., 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 69, and 82), whereas low-risk types are only rarely associated with the development of cervical cancer and, therefore, are not routinely detected by HPV tests (e. g., 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 72, and 81)<link linkend="ch0009s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Lesions with mild dysplasia are classified as LSIL (also, CIN 1), while lesions with moderate to severe dysplasia are HSIL (CIN 2 and CIN 3). It should be noted that persistent HPV infection with a high-risk type most often does not progress through all premalignant stages (i. e., LSIL and HSIL) to invasive carcinoma. All precancerous stages have a significant likelihood of regression, with a greater percentage of the low-grade abnormalities regressing compared to high-grade dysplasia (<link linkend="ch0009s0001fg02">Fig. 6.2</link>). Invasive cancer is usually diagnosed in women over 40 years old and typically more than 10 years after identification of a high-grade lesion.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  There are &gt;200 types of HPV, ~40 of which can infect the mucosal epithelium. HPV can cause either a cutaneous or mucosal infection <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib09">(9)</link>, depending on the tropism of the specific virus. Cutaneous infections present as non-genital warts, which include common warts, plantar warts, and flat warts. HPV types 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 are associated with cutaneous warts. Although relatively common in all age groups, warts occur with a peak incidence in children aged 12 to 16. Mucosal infections include genital warts; cancers of the cervix, anus, external genitalia, and oropharynx; and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Among sexually active individuals, genital warts range in prevalence from 1 to 10% with a peak incidence in 20- to 24-year-old persons. Risk factors associated with genital warts include infection with HPV types 6 and 11, introduction of new sexual partners, and an increased number of sexual partners. Cervical cancer is most commonly caused by persistent infection with types 16 and 18, which, combined, cause ~70% of cervical cancers. The remainder is caused by other high-risk HPV types. (See <link linkend="ch0009s0004x05">question 5</link> for further discussion of HPV and cervical cancer.) During the past few decades, the incidence of HPV-associated anal cancer has been on the rise <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib10">(10)</link>, particularly in men who have sex with men. Risk factors for this uncommon cancer include HPV infection, increased number of partners, genital warts, cigarette smoking, receptive anal intercourse, and HIV infection. Some cancers of the external genitalia (penile, vulvar, and vaginal cancers) are associated with HPV infections and tend to occur in younger patients than HPV-negative cancers. Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck may also be due to HPV, but like cancers of the external genitalia, not all are associated with HPV. HPV-associated head and neck cancers are primarily found in the oropharynx and the base of the tongue and tonsils <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Oral cancers due to HPV infection occur in younger individuals with increased sexual risk factors and are more common in men. Lastly, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is thought to be due to HPV acquisition during birth and presents as laryngeal warts in childhood, although adult cases have also been reported. RRP is associated with HPV types 6 and 11 and is generally benign. However, if not removed, laryngeal warts can lead to obstruction and can occasionally be aggressive and malignant.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  HPV infection requires genital contact. Thus, abstinence or a monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner will prevent HPV infection. Condom use has been shown to reduce transmission but does not completely prevent infection. Three vaccines for the prevention of HPV infection have been approved in the United States, but only one has been in use since 2016 (Gardasil 9) <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib12">(12)</link>. The nine HPV types included in the vaccine are 6 and 11, which cause ~90% of genital warts; 16 and 18, which together cause ~70% of cervical and anal cancers; and 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which cause an additional 10 to 20% of cervical cancers. The vaccine is licensed for ages 9 through 45. Routine vaccination is recommended at age 11 to 12 for boys and girls, with catch-up vaccination through age 26 <link linkend="ch0009s0002bib13">(13)</link>. The vaccine has not been shown to provide protection against other hrHPV types, which is why vaccinated women should continue to get routine cervical cancer screening by Pap smear and/or hrHPV molecular detection.</para>
        <para>The HPV vaccines are composed of HPV surface components that aggregate to form virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs contain no DNA, so there is no risk of developing HPV infection from vaccination. However, the VLPs stimulate antibody production, which protects the host against future HPV infections with the specific HPV types in the vaccine. Longitudinal outcome studies are still being performed on HPV vaccines, but the data to date indicate &gt;90% protection from persistent HPV infections and the associated precancerous changes at least 10 to 12 years post vaccination<link linkend="ch0009s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>
