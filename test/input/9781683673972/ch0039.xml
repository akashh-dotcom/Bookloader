      <sect1 id="ch0039s0004"><title>CASE 36</title><para>A 74-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) with a rash. He first noticed it a week prior on the back of his head and ears; then it spread to his face, back, stomach, neck, and groin area. He described the rash as pruritic, but not painful unless he lays on his back for a long period. His back lesions are shown in <link linkend="ch0039s0004fg01">Fig. 36.1</link>, and a close-up of his chest lesions is shown in <link linkend="ch0039s0004fg02">Fig. 36.2</link>. The patient also endorsed night sweats, weakness, and fatigue over the previous week. The patient was diagnosed with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in 2018 and was being followed by an oncologist but had not received any chemotherapy or radiation treatments.</para>

      <para>The ED and consulting dermatologist did not think that the appearance of the rash was consistent with herpes zoster (i. e., shingles) since the lesions were not dermatomal, not painful, and more papular than vesicular. A swab of a lesion on the patient’s chest (<link linkend="ch0039s0004fg02">Fig. 36.2</link>) was sent for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), and the patient was discharged with a course of oral steroids. The next day, the patient’s swab was resulted as VZV positive and HSV-1/HSV-2 negative, and his medication was changed to valacyclovir.</para>

      <para>Two days later, the patient presented again to the ED with new-onset headache and fever and continued fatigue and weakness. He was also noted to have elevated liver enzymes. He had taken one dose of valacyclovir (1 g) prior to this visit. He was admitted for treatment with intravenous acyclovir, and dermatology, oncology, and infectious diseases clinical teams were consulted. His head computed tomography (CT) scan and chest radiograph were normal, as was his ophthalmologic examination. The patient was negative for HSV, HIV, and syphilis and had negative routine blood cultures. He received a lumbar puncture due to his new-onset headache. Both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VZV NAATs were positive, confirming the diagnosis of disseminated herpes zoster.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Given the patient’s age and history of untreated CLL, noninfectious causes should be considered, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, drug reaction, contact dermatitis, and scabies <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib01">(1)</link>. A paraneoplastic process like leukemia cutis is also possible. He was seen by a dermatologist prior to presenting to the ED, who diagnosed him with pityriasis rosacea and administered an intramuscular cortisone shot. Potential infectious causes include tick-borne illnesses, secondary syphilis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, impetigo (group A streptococcal infection), <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> infection, and disseminated enteroviral infection, though his clinical presentation is not classic for any of these. The patient’s underlying viral illness was likely herpes zoster (shingles) due to reactivation of VZV, which is a member of the herpesvirus family. These are enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. Herpes zoster lesions typically develop along dermatomes <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Lesions can be seen in various stages of evolution, including macular, pustular, vesicular, and scabbed. The primary differential diagnosis of his lesions is herpes zoster and disseminated HSV infection. Other viruses that cause “pox”-like lesions are in the <emphasis>Poxviridae</emphasis> family and include the orthopoxviruses and molluscum contagiosum virus.</para>
        <para>The orthopoxviruses are important to consider, including mpox (previously monkeypox) and smallpox. Mpox is endemic in Central and West Africa and has been associated with outbreaks in the United States. There was an outbreak of mpox in the Midwest in 2003<link linkend="ch0039s0002bib03">(3)</link>. This outbreak affected 72 individuals, all of whom had exposure to prairie dogs that had been housed at the same facility with imported, mpox-infected Gambian rats. In 2022-2023, the outbreak of mpox (more than 31,000 cases and 57 deaths in the United States and more than 90,000 cases in 118 countries globally) was associated with close contact and sexual transmission in men who have sex with men <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Because of the distinct epidemiology and widespread nature of the most recent outbreak, mpox vaccines were administered to high-risk individuals <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Due to bioterrorism concerns, smallpox must also be considered. Orthopox (mpox and smallpox) lesions, unlike those of VZV, present at the same stage of development. This patient’s lesions were at various stages of development and healing, making orthopoxviruses unlikely. In addition, orthopox lesions often occur on the palms and soles of the feet and are most concentrated on the face and extremities, which was not the distribution pattern of lesions seen in this patient. If the patient had recently been vaccinated against smallpox, then disseminated vaccinia should also be in the differential.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  If the rash distribution is along one or more dermatomes, the diagnosis of herpes zoster is often made based on clinical findings alone. However, in immunocompromised patients, the presentation is not always classic and requires a laboratory diagnosis. A method that is readily accessible and combines rapidity with sensitivity is direct fluorescent-antibody staining of scrapings taken from vesicular lesions. Due to the long generation time of VZV in cell culture (up to 3 weeks), culture techniques for detection of VZV have been abandoned in favor of NAATs. The sensitivities of a direct fluorescent-antibody assay, culture, and two NAATs were demonstrated to be 87.8, 46.3, and 97.6 and 100%, respectively <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib06">(6)</link>. There is currently only one FDA-cleared NAAT for the direct detection of VZV DNA from cutaneous and mucocutaneous swabs and CSF <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  VZV has a worldwide distribution. Disease is more common in temperate regions, with annual epidemics in the late winter and spring in areas with low vaccination rates. Primary infection with VZV is varicella (chickenpox), whereas disease due to reactivation is herpes zoster (shingles). The virus is spread by the respiratory route (lungs and conjunctiva) and is highly infectious, with up to 90% of nonimmune household contacts becoming infected. VZV can also be spread by direct contact with skin lesions and fomites. About one-third of people will develop herpes zoster in their lifetime, and the risk is most closely associated with increasing age.</para>
        <para>For primary infection (varicella), the incubation period is 10 to 21 days after exposure<link linkend="ch0039s0002bib08">(8)</link>. A mild viral prodrome (i. e., fever, malaise) typically occurs prior to the onset of varicella rash. The lesions are pruritic and progress rapidly from macules to papules to vesicular lesions prior to scabbing and healing. The rash usually presents first on scalp, face, or trunk before spreading to extremities and is accompanied by fever, malaise, and/or headache. After primary infection with VZV, individuals have lifelong immunity, but they are at risk for reactivation.</para>
        <para>Herpes zoster (shingles) is a reactivation of a latent VZV infection<link linkend="ch0039s0002bib08">(8)</link>. The dorsal root ganglia are latently infected following primary infections. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI), and not anti-VZV antibody, is necessary to maintain latency. A loss in CMI, as is seen with increasing age, is associated with reactivation. Other risk factors for reactivation include CMI dysfunction (transplant, hematologic malignancies, HIV), diabetes, and even recent physiologic stress. In herpes zoster, skin lesions appear in a single dermatomal distribution innervated by the specific dorsal root or extramedullary cranial ganglia where VZV was latent.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  In general, varicella causes more severe illness in adults than in children. Immunocompromised children and nonimmune, pregnant women also are more prone to complications with primary VZV infection than is the general population. The severe illness seen with VZV in these patient populations is due largely to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with varicella pneumonia. Other complications include hepatitis, arthritis, glomerulonephritis, myocarditis, pericarditis, pancreatitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebellar ataxia <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Multiorgan involvement is associated with high mortality. Primary varicella during pregnancy can also cause intrauterine infection, leading to fetal loss or an infant born with congenital varicella syndrome, which may include dermatomal scarring, limb hypoplasia, ocular defects, low birth weight, and intellectual disability.</para>
        <para>Secondary bacterial infections of the skin lesions also occur, primarily due to <emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis> and <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib09">(9)</link>. VZV infections are associated with <emphasis>S. pyogenes</emphasis>-induced necrotizing fasciitis, as VZV skin lesions have been well recognized as an important portal of entry for <emphasis>S. pyogenes</emphasis> (group A <emphasis>Streptococcus</emphasis>). Reye’s syndrome, with encephalopathy, elevated transaminase levels, and elevated serum ammonia levels, can occur in children with varicella or influenza who take aspirin. It should be remembered that patients with VZV infection can have a prodrome characterized by fever, malaise, headache, and abdominal pain that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses. Therefore, infants and children with febrile illnesses should not be given aspirin.</para>
        <para>There are four groups of herpes zoster complications: cutaneous, visceral, neurological, and ocular. Immunocompromised patients (including patients with advanced HIV, transplant recipients, and cancer patients) are at greatest risk for complications associated with herpes zoster<link linkend="ch0039s0002bib10">(10)</link>. In immunocompromised patients, herpes zoster lesions may disseminate beyond the primary dermatome involved. Further, viremia can occur with dissemination to brain, liver, lungs, and eyes. Lesions may appear without the usual viral prodrome and may persist for months to years. Perhaps the most debilitating complication, which occurs even in immunocompetent individuals, is the persistent pain that can occur with the rash even after the lesions heal. This persistent pain is called postherpetic neuralgia.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Given the patient’s uncharacteristic lesions and his immunocompromise due to his untreated CLL, he likely had disseminated herpes zoster. The patient should receive a neurologic examination and head CT, a chest radiograph, an ophthalmologic examination, and a blood VZV NAAT to assess the status of his disseminated infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Patients with varicella are very contagious. Secondary cases are frequently more severe, likely due to high viral inoculum. Hospitalized patients with varicella must be placed in respiratory isolation (airborne precautions), and strict infection control measures regarding skin contact (handwashing, use of gloves and gowns, etc.) must be implemented (contact precautions). Precautions must remain in place until lesions are dry and scabbed. Only individuals who are nonimmune, including health care personnel, need to wear a mask. Ideally, nonimmune health care personnel should not care for a VZV-infected patient. Seronegative health care personnel who encounter a VZV-infected patient should not have contact with other patients, especially immunocompromised ones, for a minimum of 2 weeks after exposure, the incubation period of this viral infection.</para>
        <para>Patients with herpes zoster are also infectious but are estimated to be one-fifth as infectious as patients with varicella. The infection control guidance for herpes zoster depends on the patient’s immune status and whether lesions are localized or disseminated<link linkend="ch0039s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Immunocompetent patients with minimal risk for disseminated herpes zoster and localized lesions only need for lesions to be covered until dry and scabbed. For disseminated herpes zoster, the patient should be on airborne and contact precautions until lesions are dry and scabbed.</para>
        <para>There are also infection control considerations when a nonimmune person has been exposed to VZV<link linkend="ch0039s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Postexposure vaccine should be administered within 5 days of exposure. For exposed individuals who cannot receive the live vaccine, varicella-zoster immune globulin (VariZIG) should be administered as soon as possible after exposure. This would apply to immunocompromised individuals, infants, and pregnant women.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Acyclovir is beneficial in treating VZV (both varicella and herpes zoster). In immunocompetent adults ≥50 years of age, treatment with both analgesics and antivirals is recommended. In immunocompetent patients &lt;50 years old, antivirals are not necessary but can shorten the duration of illness. Because of its cost, acyclovir is often not used in uncomplicated cases. Thymidine kinase mutations in VZV conferring resistance to acyclovir have been described, though almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib13">(13)</link>. In one report, 27% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with persistent VZV infection had mutations possibly associated with resistance <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Interestingly, in patients with disseminated disease, all infected sites may not harbor the resistant virus. Therefore, it is prudent to test multiple specimen types when screening for resistance mutations.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  There are two VZV vaccines—one to prevent varicella and one to prevent herpes zoster. The varicella vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine, while the herpes zoster vaccine is a recombinant vaccine. The live varicella vaccine should not be given to immunocompromised individuals, including those with a hematologic malignancy, congenital immunodeficiency, or symptomatic HIV infection. Persons receiving high-dose immunosuppressive drugs and pregnant women should also not receive live vaccines. The varicella vaccine is licensed for use in the United States for all children &gt;12 months of age. Current recommendations call for the vaccine to be given in two doses—the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Adolescents and adults with no previous evidence of disease should receive two doses of the vaccine 4 to 8 weeks apart. The vaccine is very efficacious, vaccine failures are rare, and it has been shown to be particularly effective at preventing severe VZV disease. Postlicensure vaccine safety surveillance using the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has shown the vaccine to be remarkably safe, though both vaccine-associated and natural infections have been noted postvaccination. Serious infections and deaths due to infection caused by the vaccine strain have been observed but are quite rare (1 death/1,000,000 doses of vaccine administered). In the prevaccine era, there were ~4 million cases of varicella annually in the United States, which translates to 15 to 16 cases per 1,000. The incidence dropped 97% in the United States after routine vaccination programs were implemented <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib08">(8)</link>.</para>
        <para>The recombinant herpes zoster vaccine is recommended for individuals ≥50 years of age and adults 19 years and older who are or will be immunosuppressed<link linkend="ch0039s0002bib16">(16)</link>. The vaccine is two doses given 2 to 6 months apart. The target population for vaccination is individuals ≥60 years of age due to the higher rate of herpes zoster and its complications in this population. The initial clinical trial data with a live, attenuated high-dose vaccine in ≥60-year-olds showed that the vaccine reduced the incidence of herpes zoster by 51% and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia by 67%. Immunocompromised patients were ineligible to receive the live, attenuated vaccine, so the recombinant vaccine is now preferred. The recombinant vaccine had &gt;90% clinical efficacy in all recipients ≥50 years old <link linkend="ch0039s0002bib17">(17)</link>. Additionally, there were no cases of postherpetic neuralgia in adults 50 to 69 years of age (control group, 0.18%) and only 0.05% of recipients in the ≥70 age group experienced postherpetic neuralgia (control group, 0.43%).</para>
        <para>Two questions remain unanswered concerning the effect of these vaccines on the natural progression of disease. First, will individuals who receive the varicella vaccine be at risk for herpes zoster due to the vaccine strain later in life? Limited data suggest that they may, but that the rates and severity of herpes zoster are reduced compared with those in individuals who have natural disease. Second, will immunity wane in adults who received the varicella vaccine as a child? As natural disease declines, this could result in an at-risk population. Since adults are most vulnerable to severe varicella disease, this is a legitimate concern. Twenty-year follow-up data suggest that immunity persists, but these studies were done in settings where natural disease continues to be common, offering the opportunity for immunized individuals to receive a “booster” effect from exposure to infected individuals.</para>
