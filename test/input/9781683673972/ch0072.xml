      <sect1 id="ch0072s0004"><title>CASE 69</title><para>The patient was a 21-year-old college student who was referred to the infectious disease clinic from student health services because of anorexia, fatigue, and a 20-lb (9-kg) weight loss. She was also experiencing shaking chills and sweats. The patient’s history was significant for her emigration from Uzbekistan 4 years previously to attend a university in the United States. Her parents were both alive, and she had two healthy siblings. She had a pet dog when she was younger, but there were no other notable exposures. She had one sexual partner and was not currently sexually active. Seven months prior, she had had surgery in Uzbekistan during which a multiloculated cystic lesion was removed from her liver.</para>
      <para>She gave no history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or genitourinary tract complaints. Upon physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits. She had some hair loss but no rash or skin changes, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago, with no current vaginal bleeding. She had no lymphadenopathy and her pulmonary examination was unremarkable. Her abdominal examination was significant for diffuse tenderness to palpation that was most pronounced in the left lower quadrant. Laboratory tests, including a white blood cell count and liver function tests, were all within normal limits. An abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated a 10- by 5.6-cm multiloculated cystic lesion in the rectouterine pouch as well as a 4- by 5-cm multiloculated lesion in the liver.</para>

      <para>The patient received a combination of antimicrobial therapy, 10 days of albendazole and praziquantel, the PAIR procedure to aspirate the cyst, and surgical removal, due to concern that prior surgical intervention alone had been unsuccessful and the patient was likely experiencing relapse. In addition, this young woman was quite concerned about retaining her fertility. The gynecologist caring for her believed a surgical approach where the anatomy could be visualized and the cysts dissected away from the reproductive organs was the optimal approach to achieve this. The patient was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparoscopy. Two abdominal cysts were removed, one adherent to the posterior abdominal and uterine wall. The other was adherent to the left ovary and fallopian tube. Prior to removal, both cysts were entered, drained, and then filled with 20% saline solution (PAIR procedure). The cysts were wrapped in sponges soaked in 20% saline to kill any protoscolices that might leak to prevent the formation of secondary cysts.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Several things need consideration in a young woman with a pelvic mass. The most likely explanation is an ovarian mass that is either benign or malignant. Second, if she had been sexually active, ectopic pregnancy would be on the differential, although this patient’s lack of vaginal bleeding made this less likely. The third possibility is that the patient had intra-abdominal and liver bacterial abscesses. However, a fourth possibility exists for this patient for two reasons. First, she had a liver and pelvic mass that were both multiloculated. This is consistent with a hydatid cyst due to infection with <emphasis>E. granulosus</emphasis>. Second, she lived in a region of the world with a high prevalence of <emphasis>E. granulosus</emphasis> infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Cystic echinococcosis is caused by <emphasis>E. granulosus</emphasis>, a canine tapeworm (cestode) for which dogs, wolves, coyotes, hyenas, foxes, and other canids act as definitive hosts <link linkend="ch0072s0002bib01">(1)</link>. In the natural life cycle of this parasite, an infected dog defecates eggs into an area where ungulates graze. An egg is ingested by an intermediate host (ungulates such as sheep, cows, goats, or pigs), and the ingested egg releases an oncosphere into the small intestine. That oncosphere migrates primarily to the liver or the lung, where it forms hydatid cysts. Protoscolices, the infective form of the parasite for the definitive canid host, develop within the cyst. The life cycle is completed when canids ingest cysts containing protoscolices in infected organs from an intermediate host. This may occur when uncooked viscera are fed to dogs by humans. The protoscolices evaginate and attach to the canid intestinal wall and develop into adult worms that produce eggs, which continues the life cycle.</para>
        <para>Humans are accidental intermediate hosts. Humans may ingest eggs directly from dogs; the eggs can adhere to fur or be found on paws and muzzles. Alternatively, humans may ingest eggs from food or water contaminated with dog feces.</para>
        <para>The natural history of the disease has been closely studied in humans. In most humans, cysts grow slowly or may not grow at all. It takes several months before protoscolices are produced within the cyst, but they may not be produced at all. Such cysts are sterile. The clinical disease associated with this parasite is based on cyst size and location and, therefore, the rate at which the cysts expand. In 90% of patients, the cysts expand at a rate of &lt;1.5 cm/year<link linkend="ch0072s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Because a cyst must be ~10 cm to cause symptoms (unless it is in an uncommon site such as the brain), it may be years before infected patients become symptomatic. In 10% of patients, cyst expansion can be quite rapid—as rapid as 15 cm in 1 year. It has been observed that most cysts are seen in patients between 20 and 40 years of age, which is the age of the patient presented here. Data indicate that the rate of cyst expansion is higher in children and adolescents and then declines with age. This may explain why the disease is most prevalent in early adulthood. The abdominal discomfort the patient experienced was likely due to the mass effect of the expanding abdominal cysts.</para>
        <para>The WHO-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis has described a standardized classification system for cysts based on ultrasound<link linkend="ch0072s0002bib03">(3)</link>. It progresses from undifferentiated “cystic lesion” to active cyst stages CE1 and CE2, to transitional cysts (CE3), and finally inactive cyst stages CE4 and CE5. Staging the cyst is important as it can impact choice of management but also influences the expected performance of some diagnostics.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Noninvasive diagnostic options include a combination of imaging to visualize the presence of a cyst and serologic testing to assess for antibodies specific to <emphasis>Echinococcus</emphasis>, indicating exposure. Together, these results indicate a presumptive diagnosis of echinococcosis. Serologic testing is most commonly performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and detects immunoglobulin G antibodies, but other methods include indirect hemagglutination, immunochromatographic tests, and Western blot. It should be noted that antibody detection is not universal in patients with echinococcosis, as some individuals will not seroconvert, potentially due to the noninflammatory nature of the laminate layer of glycosylated mucins surrounding the cyst <link linkend="ch0072s0002bib04">(4)</link>. In a summary of ELISA performance, greatest sensitivity was seen in active cyst stages CE2 and CE3 (≥90%) <link linkend="ch0072s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Lower sensitivity is reported for CE1 (~75%) and it drops to ~50% for inactive CE4/CE5 cysts. Cross-reactivity can be seen with <emphasis>Echincoccus multilocularis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Taenia solium</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>If the cyst is aspirated, microscopy of hydatid fluid or cytology can be performed to look for evidence of hydatid cyst material, protoscolices, or hooklets, the “tooth-like” structures used for attachment to the intestinal wall. If the cyst is surgically removed, histopathology can be performed looking for similar evidence.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Multiple options for management exist and can be used concomitantly to achieve the highest likelihood of resolution. The first approach is to use long-term antiparasitic therapy, including albendazole. The cure rate for this approach is 70 to 80%, with a relapse rate as high as 25% <link linkend="ch0072s0002bib06">(6)</link>. A second treatment strategy is to perform a procedure called PAIR. In this method, the cyst is punctured, the contents are aspirated, 20% saline or 85% alcohol is instilled into the cyst, and then the cyst is reaspirated after a 5-minute dwell time that is required to kill the protoscolices; thus the term “PAIR” (puncture, aspiration, instillation, reaspiration). The patient also receives albendazole prior to the procedure and for 15 to 30 days afterward. This procedure has been reported to have a cure rate of &gt;90% and a relapse rate of &lt;5%. The third option is surgical removal of the pelvic cysts. The combination of surgery and presurgery antimicrobial therapy was chosen because it has the highest cure rate and the lowest likelihood of relapse <link linkend="ch0072s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Presurgical antimicrobial therapy is becoming more common when echinococcal serology is positive or there is a high index of suspicion of the disease, such as in people who have had contact with dogs in areas of the world with high disease prevalence. One of the greatest concerns in managing echinococcal cysts surgically is the potential for spillage of cyst contents. Fatal anaphylactic reactions to live protoscolices have been associated with this spillage, although it must be stated that this reaction occurs in only about 1 in 750 patients. Treatment with albendazole has been shown to reduce the risk of these reactions and thus is often used prior to surgery. The final approach is to do nothing, as these cysts often grow slowly and may calcify. In some individuals, cyst growth is quite slow, and it may take as long as 10 years for a cyst to grow as much as 1 cm. Most patients with cysts of &lt;7.5 cm in diameter are asymptomatic, though this depends largely on the location of the cyst. Because this patient had cysts that appeared to grow rapidly, this final option was not realistic.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  The structures seen in <link linkend="ch0072s0004fg01">Fig. 69.1</link> and <link linkend="ch0072s0004fg01">69.2</link> are diagnostic for <emphasis>Echinococcus</emphasis>. <link linkend="ch0072s0004fg01">Figure 69.1</link> shows a protoscolex with a “crown” of hooklets in the center. The ribbon-like material seen in <link linkend="ch0072s0004fg01">Fig. 69.2</link> is the laminate layer of the hydatid cyst wall. The laminate layer is an acellular elastic structure made of concentric layers of glycosylated mucins that surround the cyst. It does not elicit an inflammatory response and serves to protect the cyst from the host’s immune system. Both of these structures are quite distinctive for <emphasis>Echinococcus</emphasis>. <link linkend="ch0072s0004fg01">Figure 69.3</link> is a Fite-Faraco stain of a cytology cell block section. The hooklets of <emphasis>Echinococcus</emphasis> are acid fast, and acid-fast stains can be used to highlight their presence.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Alveolar echinococcosis is caused by <emphasis>E. multilocularis</emphasis>. <emphasis>E. multilocularis</emphasis> is found across northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia <link linkend="ch0072s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Similar to <emphasis>E. granulosus</emphasis>, humans are accidental intermediate hosts in the <emphasis>E. multilocularis</emphasis> life cycle, when humans consume contaminated food or water containing eggs. As the name would suggest, <emphasis>E. multilocularis</emphasis> produces multiple, mutiloculated microcysts usually in the liver, unlike the large uniloculated cyst of <emphasis>E. granulosus</emphasis>. These multiloculated vesicles are more likely to spread and rapidly proliferate as compared to <emphasis>E. granulosus</emphasis>, leading to more significant damage and rapid progression of disease. Diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis is largely dependent on imaging. Serology serves a complementary role but may be more reliably positive in patients with alveolar echinococcosis, as an immune response is more readily exposed to antigens in the multivesicular formation. Surgical intervention is more commonly needed in alveolar echinococcus to remove the mass of cysts.</para>
