      <para>The patient had a CMV qPCR performed every 1 to 3 weeks posttransplant with “not detected” results until ~9 months posttransplant, when her result was 250 IU/ml. She simultaneously presented with nonspecific systemic symptoms including fever, malaise, and diarrhea and was clinically diagnosed with CMV syndrome (i. e., disease). Due to her positive CMV qPCR and presumed CMV disease, valganciclovir was prescribed, and weekly CMV qPCR was performed. Her results are shown in <link linkend="ch0021s0004fg01">Fig. 18.1</link>. The patient’s level of viremia began to decline after 10 days of valganciclovir, but remained detectable, but not quantifiable (i. e., &lt;200 IU/ml); her systemic symptoms resolved. After about 3 months on valganciclovir, her viral load began to rise again. She was admitted for treatment with intravenous ganciclovir.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Previously, it was considered too risky to transplant an organ from an HCV-positive donor given the high rate of viral transmission and the inability to cure hepatitis C, so these organs were only used in recipients who had chronic HCV or were discarded. However, there are many more patients waiting for a transplant than there are donors, alive or deceased. Further, wait times are long, leading to increased mortality for those waiting for an available and compatible organ <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib01">(1)</link>. While the opioid epidemic has unfortunately increased the number of deceased donors, this population is also at greater risk for HCV infection. There are more than 100,000 patients waiting for a transplant in the United States, and ~17 people die each day due to the lack of organ procurement. Advances in treating and curing hepatitis C have altered the risk-benefit ratio of transplanting organs from HCV-positive donors. (See <ulink url="ch0035.xml#ch0035">case 32</ulink> for more discussion on HCV.) The patient underwent a rigorous informed consent process and accepted the risks associated with receiving an HCV-positive organ.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The patient was at greatest risk for HCV and CMV infections due to her negative serostatus and the donor’s positive status for both viruses, but she was also at risk for complications due to EBV. The donor was NAAT positive for HCV, meaning they were viremic, which increases the infection risk of the recipient. Had the donor been HCV seropositive but NAAT negative, the risk would be significantly lower, though infection would still be possible since HCV might be present in the transplanted organ (especially liver) but not detectable in the peripheral blood that is tested pretransplant. The mismatch in donor and recipient CMV serologies (donor positive/recipient negative [D+/R–]) carries the highest risk for CMV infection in the posttransplant period <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib02">(2)</link>. CMV serologies D+/R+ and D–/R+ carry an intermediate risk, while D–/R– has the lowest risk. Although she was seropositive for EBV, she was at risk for EBV-associated complications like posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder due to reactivation of latent virus. (See <ulink url="ch0061.xml#ch0061">case 58</ulink> for more discussion on EBV.)</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  HCV-negative recipients of organs from HCV viremic donors are treated with HCV-specific antivirals (direct-acting agents [DAAs]). See <ulink url="ch0035.xml#ch0035">case 32</ulink> for further discussion of DAAs. For non-liver organ recipients, treatment should begin pretransplant or as soon as they are clinically stable within 1 week of transplant. Liver recipients should be treated within 2 weeks of the transplant, but ideally within 1 week. Based on limited studies, nearly all solid organ recipients are successfully treated after 12 weeks of DAA treatment, though some treatment interruptions have been reported <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Studies indicate no differences between HCV-positive and HCV-negative transplants in terms of graft function, rejection, or survival for most organs; heart transplants need additional studies to ascertain whether there is increased risk for graft rejection. Although initial outcomes support the practice of transplanting HCV-positive organs, more studies are needed, especially to assess optimal timing of DAA treatment and long-term graft and patient outcomes.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  NAAT, and particularly qpCR, performed on the patient’s blood is the standard for diagnosing CMV disease, assisting in making decisions regarding preemptive therapy, and monitoring response to therapy in posttransplant patients <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib04">(4)</link>. There are currently no guidelines detailing the level of viremia that should trigger therapeutic intervention, but data in the literature suggest it is ~2,000 IU/ml for solid organ transplants and 100 to 1,000 IU/ml for hematopoietic stem cell transplants (<link linkend="ch0021s0002bib05">5</link>, <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib06">6</link>). An international standard is available to normalize interlaboratory variability of CMV viral load results, which will be reflected in the quantified result being reported in IU per milliliter (as opposed to copies per milliliter). The adoption of the universal standard by commercial tests should allow the determination of clinically relevant quantitative thresholds, though interassay variability is still observed. For now, an absolute viral quantity may not be as important as the trend of a patient’s viral load over time. The presence of higher amounts of CMV DNA in the blood correlates with a higher likelihood of clinical disease. One of the concerns of using qPCR for detecting CMV in the peripheral blood is the inability to differentiate latent virus from actively replicating virus. Although qPCR can be performed on both whole blood and plasma, plasma is generally preferred to decrease the number of latently infected cells that are amplified. In theory, primarily “free,” and therefore actively replicating, virus would be present in plasma, as opposed to the cell-associated virus present latently in peripheral white cells. This theory is not absolute, so the need for clinically relevant viral thresholds for therapeutic decisions is critical.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>Given the pretransplant D+/R– serologies, the likely source of her CMV infection was the donor organ. CMV is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus and is the most common infectious agent complicating transplantation. In the absence of antiviral prophylaxis, CMV infections usually occur 1 to 3 months posttransplant. However, depending on the length of prophylactic therapy, the window for CMV infection can extend beyond a year. CMV, like other herpesviruses, causes lifelong latent infection. In patients who are CMV positive pretransplant (i. e., latently infected), infections posttransplant are usually the result of reactivation of latent viral infection. Another potential source of infection is blood transfusion, though most transplant centers use leukoreduced blood to lessen this risk because ~50 to 80% of blood donors are CMV positive.</para>
        <para>CMV infections are common in immunocompetent individuals, but clinical disease is rare. The immunosuppression of cell-mediated immunity necessary in transplantation greatly increases the likelihood of developing clinical disease with CMV. This is an important point conceptually. Infection does not necessarily mean that an individual will be sick. One may become “infected” with an infectious agent, as measured by an immune response to that agent, without developing any clinical manifestations of that infection. If the organism can cause latent infection, immunosuppression of a latently infected patient may result in reactivation and the development of clinical disease.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>   In addition to transplant recipients, people with advanced HIV and newborns can develop severe CMV infections. Individuals with advanced HIV may develop CMV retinitis, which can result in blindness <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib07">(7)</link>. The incidence of this is low in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Retinitis is rarely seen in transplant recipients. Patients with advanced HIV may also present with CMV pneumonia, but it is typically less severe than that seen in posttransplant patients. CMV esophagitis and colitis are also observed in patients living with HIV. The reasons for the different patterns of CMV disease in these high-risk populations are unclear.</para>
        <para>Neonatal CMV infection can occur either<emphasis>in utero</emphasis> (congenital infection) or after contact with CMV-positive maternal genital secretions during birth or via the consumption of CMV-positive breast milk. Seronegative women who get primary, but not necessarily symptomatic, CMV infection during pregnancy are at greatest risk for fetal transmission <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Approximately 30 to 50% of women of childbearing age are CMV seronegative, but only 1 to 4% will have primary CMV infection during pregnancy. Of these women with primary infections, approximately one-third will pass the virus to their fetus. A minority of neonates with congenital CMV infection have symptoms at birth (~10%). Signs and symptoms include microcephaly, chorioretinitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and rash (petechiae). About 90% of those born with symptoms and 5 to 10% of those asymptomatically infected will have long-term sequelae of CMV infection such as deafness and psychomotor impairment. Routine screening of neonates for CMV includes testing urine, saliva, and/or blood (including dried blood spots) by NAAT <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Screening for congenital CMV is now required in some states. While saliva is a convenient sample and saliva NAAT is highly sensitive, urine should also be tested to improve clinical specificity.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  CMV infections following solid organ transplantation are common, occurring in 8 to 50% of recipients depending on the organ that was transplanted and the CMV serostatus of the recipient and donor. The spectrum of CMV disease in these individuals ranges from asymptomatic infections to life-threatening disease <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Most clinical CMV disease is classified as mild to moderate, with more severe disease being seen primarily in seronegative recipients of seropositive organs. Most commonly, CMV disease presents nonspecifically as fever in the setting of neutropenia. However, it can also manifest with lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, as well as a variety of gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms. Rarely, severe CMV disease will present with meningitis. CMV infection has a predilection for the transplanted organ. For example, it causes hepatitis in liver transplant recipients, pneumonitis in heart-lung transplant recipients, and nephritis in kidney transplant recipients. CMV-associated myocarditis does occur in heart transplant recipients, but it is rare. In addition to its direct effects, CMV infection may also have indirect effects due to secondary immunologic phenomena leading to allograft injury and/or rejection, other opportunistic infections, and EBV-associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  It is possible that the patient was not compliant with taking her medication as an outpatient, or that the patient needed a higher treatment dose, which was, in part, why she was admitted. The most likely explanation is that the virus had developed resistance, particularly given her previous prophylactic therapy. Valganciclovir is an oral prodrug of ganciclovir that is converted to the parent compound by intestinal and hepatic esterases. It inhibits viral replication by inhibiting the activity of CMV DNA polymerase. Ganciclovir must be phosphorylated three times to be active. The first phosphorylation occurs by the CMV-derived serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by UL97, while the last two phosphorylations occur by host cellular enzymes. Mutations in the active site of the viral kinase confer resistance to ganciclovir.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>CMV genotyping (i. e., drug resistance testing) should be performed<link linkend="ch0021s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Molecular methods have replaced culture-based methods for detecting resistance in CMV due to the extended time CMV takes to grow in culture to perform traditional plaque reduction assays. Molecular detection of mutations associated with a resistance phenotype is performed by either Sanger sequencing (amplification followed by sequencing of the PCR products) or next-generation sequencing, which uses an unbiased approach. The genes that are interrogated for mutations are UL97 (kinase), UL54 (polymerase), and UL56 (terminase complex). There must be adequate viral DNA present in the sample (&gt;1,000 IU/ml) to genotype. Although it is more standardized, Sanger sequencing has the disadvantage of potentially missing subpopulations of resistant virus that represent &lt;20% of the total genomes present. For CMV genotyping, next-generation sequencing is more sensitive than Sanger sequencing, which may allow earlier detection of minor populations of resistant variants. There are no FDA-approved CMV genotyping tests, but some laboratories have developed laboratory-developed tests and validated them for clinical use.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  A mutation (A594V) in the UL97 gene of CMV that confers resistance was detected, but no other resistance mutations were detected. This confirms that the patient’s increase in viral load during ganciclovir therapy was due to mutations in the viral kinase gene. Three additional drugs are available for the treatment of CMV infections: foscarnet, cidofovir, and maribavir <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Letermovir is approved for prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Like ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir inhibit viral replication by inhibiting the activity of CMV DNA polymerase. While ganciclovir must be phosphorylated three times to be active, cidofovir requires two phosphorylation steps, both performed by host cellular enzymes. Foscarnet is a noncompetitive inhibitor of CMV DNA polymerase that acts by blocking the cleavage of pyrophosphate from the deoxynucleotide triphosphates, preventing chain elongation. Mutations in the UL97 sequence that result in resistance to ganciclovir do not confer resistance to cidofovir, foscarnet, or maribavir. Maribavir also targets UL97, inhibiting viral replication encapsidation and nuclear egress; it is used for the treatment of posttransplant CMV disease refractory to other therapy <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Mutations in the CMV DNA polymerase (UL54) can result in resistance to ganciclovir, cidofovir, and/or foscarnet, including mutations that confer multidrug resistance. A few studies suggest that as with HIV and herpes simplex virus, CMV drug-resistant mutants may prove to be less fit and therefore less virulent than wild-type CMV. Patients who fail or cannot tolerate ganciclovir or valganciclovir therapy are usually treated with foscarnet <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Cidofovir is used primarily in CMV-infected patients with advanced HIV, especially those with retinitis who have failed alternative therapies. CMV drug resistance is rare in solid organ recipients, making ganciclovir and valganciclovir the drugs of choice in this patient population. However, with the routine use of prophylactic strategies (as opposed to relying solely on preemptive therapy), resistance is becoming more of a concern <link linkend="ch0021s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>
