        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The patient’s presentation is consistent with urethritis. The most common infectious causes of urethritis are <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> (gonococcal urethritis; GU) and <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis> (non-gonococcal urethritis; NGU). Other causes of NGU include <emphasis>Mycoplasma genitalium</emphasis>, <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis>, and herpes simplex virus (HSV).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  NAATs are the recommended methods for diagnosing all the listed causes of GU and NGU due to the increased sensitivity compared to other methods, while maintaining high specificity <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib01">(1)</ulink>. NAATs for <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis> are FDA approved when testing urine, endocervical, vaginal, and urethral samples. Some assays are also FDA approved for extragenital sites, including rectal and pharyngeal sources. Conjunctival swabs, used primarily in the diagnosis of congenital gonorrhea or chlamydia, are not FDA-approved sample types for NAAT testing, but some laboratories have internally validated this source as a laboratory-developed test. <emphasis>M. genitalium</emphasis> NAATs are FDA approved from urine or urethral samples, while <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> NAATs are FDA approved for all GU samples previously listed. <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> can also be tested via saline wet mount from endocervical or urethral swabs or rapid test from vaginal swabs where NAAT testing is not available. HSV NAAT is recommended from a swab of a lesion when present. In addition to these diagnostic tests for urethritis, screening for HIV is recommended for all sexually active men ages 13 to 64 years and syphilis screening is recommended for adults at increased risk, which includes males &lt;29 years of age <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib02">(2)</ulink>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  People with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) frequently do not return for follow-up care, so the administration of antimicrobials before being released from the ED (or clinic) is essential. Current CDC-recommended empiric therapy guidelines for urethritis include a single 500-mg IM injection of ceftriaxone (for gonorrhea) and 100 mg of oral doxycycline twice daily for 7 days (for chlamydia) <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib03">(3)</ulink>. For an in-depth discussion of <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis>, see <ulink url="ch0006.xml#ch0006">case 3</ulink>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  There are three possibilities to consider. The first is that the patient had persistent N. gonorrhoeae infection. Ceftriaxone-resistant <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> isolates have been detected globally, a significant threat to the currently recommended treatment regimens. The greatest increase in such cases has been observed in the Asia-Pacific region, but detections have also occurred in other countries. However, to date CDC reports that ceftriaxone-resistant isolates have not been detected in the United States. A graphical representation of antimicrobial resistance in <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> over the past century is shown in <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0001fg01">Fig. 2.1</ulink>. Ceftriaxone resistance is an unlikely explanation for this patient given he received appropriate therapy and stated that symptoms resolved prior to the second presentation. The second possibility is reinfection. While the patient did not report any new sexual partners, he was not abstinent and could have acquired a new <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> infection. Finally, there is the possibility of a persistent positive <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> NAAT due to the detection of residual DNA from the prior infection. An important consideration for the use of NAAT testing as a test of cure or for diagnosis in close temporal proximity to a prior infection is the expected length of time that “leftover” DNA from successfully treated organisms may remain in the sample type. The most likely explanation for this patient’s positive <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> NAAT and symptoms was reinfection.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Following appropriate therapy, <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> DNA from nonviable organisms clears from urogenital samples within about a week <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib04">(4)</ulink>. It is recommended that subsequent testing following an infection be performed at least 2 weeks after completion of therapy. Studies looking at repeat testing for <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis> found residual DNA for up to 3 weeks; therefore, at least a 1-month interval is recommended before subsequent NAAT testing <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib05">(5)</ulink>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Culture of <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> and susceptibility testing are recommended for patients with suspected treatment failure. This recommendation accomplishes two goals: (i) isolation of the organism from a clinical sample eliminates the possibility of persistent detection of residual DNA by NAAT; and (ii) the possibility of treatment failure due to antimicrobial resistance can be investigated. <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> is a fastidious Gram-negative, intracellular diplococcus. As such, isolation of <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>requires enriched media (e. g., chocolate agar) incubated in a 5% CO<subscript>2</subscript> environment. To inhibit the growth of normal microbiota from the sampling site and enhance recovery of <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, specially designed media such as modified Thayer-Martin or GC-Lect can be used <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib06">(6)</ulink>. <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> is a labile organism, and viability can be impacted by protracted transport times between collection and plating. In such cases, a transport medium, such as Amies transport, should be considered <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib07">(7)</ulink>. Procedures and interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing on <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> are outlined in the CLSI M100 <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib08">(8)</ulink>. Gradient diffusion testing is also available through regional public health laboratories in the CDC’s ARLN <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib09">(9)</ulink>. Consultation with CDC experts is recommended in cases of suspected treatment failure <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib10">(10)</ulink>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Testing conducted through CDC’s ARLN includes fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), macrolides (azithromycin), and cephalosporins (cefixime and ceftriaxone). CLSI also recommends testing tetracycline as a first-line agent.</para>
        <para>Fluoroquinolone-resistant <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> emerged in the early 2000s. In 2007, in response to rising resistance, CDC removed fluoroquinolones from the recommended therapies for <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib11">(11)</ulink>. Resistance rates of 20 to 30% continue to be observed <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib12">(12)</ulink>. Mechanisms of resistance include mutations in the <emphasis>gyrA</emphasis> and <emphasis>parC</emphasis> genes, along with mutations in the efflux pump-encoding gene <emphasis>mtrR</emphasis> <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib13">(13)</ulink>.</para>
        <para>Macrolide resistance, specifically azithromycin resistance, increased in surveillance data in the early 2010s to an average of 2.5%. The highest rates of resistance were seen in the Midwest. At that time, dual therapy, including a cephalosporin and azithromycin, was the regimen of choice. In 2015, citing rising rates of macrolide resistance and antimicrobial stewardship concerns, azithromycin was excluded from the recommended treatment in favor of ceftriaxone monotherapy<ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib14">(14)</ulink>. Mechanisms of resistance include mutations in the <emphasis>rrl</emphasis> gene, methylation of the 23S rRNA gene, and overexpression of efflux pumps <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib13">(13)</ulink>.</para>
        <para>Cefixime and ceftriaxone are both third-generation (extended-spectrum) cephalosporins. Historically, resistance to these agents was rare. In fact, CLSI interpretive criteria for both drugs only include a susceptible breakpoint (no resistant interpretation), an indication of the limited data on extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> needed to inform such interpretation. However, elevated MICs, cefixime MIC of ≥0.25 μg/ml or ceftriaxone MIC of ≥0.125 μg/ml, referred to as nonsusceptible, have been observed. Rates of nonsusceptibility observed in surveillance data are higher for cefixime, up to 1.4%, than ceftriaxone, which has remained &lt;1% <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib12">(12)</ulink>. In 2020, with antimicrobial stewardship in mind and a focus on preserving cephalosporin susceptibility for <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis>, the CDC removed cefixime from the recommended treatment options in favor of IM ceftriaxone. This rationale is in part supported by data showing that IM ceftriaxone is more active against <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> with elevated MICs when compared to oral cefixime <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib15">(15)</ulink>. Mechanisms of resistance for low-level cephalosporin nonsusceptibility include mutations in the <emphasis>penA</emphasis> gene and overexpression of efflux pumps. High-level resistance is also mediated through changes in the <emphasis>penA</emphasis> gene, although unique from those seen in low-level resistance.</para>
        <para>For decades, tetracycline resistance in <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> has been high. As of 2021, CDC’s Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project reported a resistance rate of ~20% <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib16">(16)</ulink>. Resistance is both plasmid and chromosomally mediated <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib13">(13)</ulink>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  CDC recommends contacting sexual partners within the preceding 60 days of the patient's infection, or most recent sexual partner if last contact was &gt;60 days. These contacts should be offered testing and presumptive therapy in an attempt to treat unrecognized cases and prevent further transmission.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  NAAT testing is still the recommended testing strategy in cases of suspected child abuse. Testing should be performed using FDA-approved methodologies, although no test is FDA approved for children <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib17">(17)</ulink>. Therefore, discussion with laboratory experts is needed to ensure that testing has been rigorously validated to CLIA standards when testing samples from children <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib18">(18)</ulink>. Every effort should be made to ensure specificity for <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> in testing and avoid potential false positives with non-gonococcal <emphasis>Neisseria</emphasis> that may be part of normal microbiota. This can be accomplished by confirmatory testing using NAATs that differ in detection targets or chemistry <ulink url="ch0005.xml#ch0005s0002bib05">(5)</ulink>. Additionally, culture and isolation of <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> can be used to confirm the molecular result. Certainty in the diagnosis of gonorrhea in cases of child abuse is paramount given the social and medicolegal implications.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Doxy PEP is a strategy of prescribing doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis to prevent bacterial STIs. Taken within 72 hours of sexual contact, prophylactic doxycycline has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of syphilis and chlamydia infections (&gt;70%) and gonorrhea (50%). CDC recommends offering doxy PEP to men who have sex with men and transgender women, particularly to individuals who have had a bacterial STI within the past year. STI screening and discussion around HIV preexposure prophylaxis or strategies to prevent other STIs not covered by prophylactic doxycycline should also occur.</para>
