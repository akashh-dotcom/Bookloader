      <sect1 id="ch0064s0004"><title>CASE 61</title><para>The patient was a 16-year-old male from a rural community with a prior medical history of three hospitalizations for pneumonia treated with intravenous (IV) antimicrobials. At the time of admission, he was no longer attending high school. He reported using tobacco and alcohol and may have used IV drugs. No sexual history was reported. He had received all vaccinations appropriate for his age, including Menactra, at age 12.</para>
      <para>One day prior to admission, he developed myalgias, fatigue, nausea, and emesis. He visited his primary care physician the next morning, where he was noted on physical exam to have a petechial rash. At that time, the physician sent the patient to his local hospital’s emergency department (ED).</para>

Otherwise, his physical examination was normal except for decreased sensations in his lower extremities and feet. Blood cultures were obtained. It was noted that the patient was allergic to cephalosporins. As a result, he was then begun on IV meropenem, vancomycin, and fluconazole.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Petechial lesions are an important sign of fulminant meningococcal infections <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Petechial lesions result from intravascular coagulation and endothelial cell damage due to the interaction of the host with the infecting organism (see <phrase>answer to question 11</phrase> for further details). Death may occur within hours of disease onset. He was started on IV antimicrobials and received appropriate supportive care for SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome). Other organisms that can cause petechial lesions and can progress rapidly include <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>, <emphasis>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Rickettsia rickettsii</emphasis>. <emphasis>C. canimorsus</emphasis> was unlikely because dogs are the most common source of this infection, and the patient did not have exposure to a dog. <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis> infection was also unlikely because the organism is tick-borne and not seen in the wintertime, when this patient presented to the hospital.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Menactra is a conjugated, quadrivalent vaccine against <emphasis>Neisseria meningitidis</emphasis> serogroup A, C, W, and Y capsular polysaccharide conjugated with diphtheria toxoid <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib02">(2)</link>. There currently three different conjugated quadrivalent vaccines against these four serotypes. Invasive <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> infections are seen most commonly in children under 1 year of age, with a second peak seen in adolescents and young adults. Although invasive <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> infections are uncommon in the United States, with &lt;400 cases annually, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices still recommends that preadolescents receive a conjugated, quadrivalent vaccine at 11 to 12 years of age and again at 16 years of age because of the increased risk of disease outbreaks in this age group <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Additional populations at increased risk for invasive <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> disease include asplenic people, people with complement deficiencies or those receiving biologics that inactivate complement or complement components, and individuals living with HIV <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib02">(2)</link>. People traveling to or temporarily living in areas with increased case numbers of invasive meningococcal infections should receive the vaccine beginning at 2 months of age. In other countries with increased case numbers of invasive meningococcal disease, conjugated, quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine series are given to infants <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  SIRS has a broad range of potential microbial causes. Because of the severity of his infection, the empiric therapy for this patient included vancomycin to treat Gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin-resistant <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> and methicillin-resistant <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>; meropenem to treat Gram-negative bacteria, specifically <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis>; and fluconazole to treat yeast, primarily <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Candida albicans</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Ceftriaxone is frequently used empirically to treat Gram-negative organisms in people with SIRS. Because this patient was allergic to this antimicrobial, it could not be used. During tick season (March to October), doxycycline should be included for patients with petechial rashes to treat <emphasis>R. rickettsii</emphasis> infection, which is not susceptible to any of the three agents with which the patient was empirically treated. Untreated, the mortality of <emphasis>R. rickettsii </emphasis>infection is similar to that of fulminant meningococcemia <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Although the patient met only three of the four criteria for SIRS: fever above 38°C, tachycardia, WBC count &gt;12,000/μl, but not tachypnea, he clearly had significant systemic inflammation based on his highly elevated CRP and ESR levels. Given his unclear IV drug use history, there was concern for both HIV and HCV infection. HIV is a risk factor for meningococcal infection in people living with HIV who have a low CD4 count or high viral load <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  An important complication of invasive meningococcal disease is bacterial meningitis. The mortality of this infection is 15%. If the patient has meningitis, this may change the antimicrobial therapy. Depending on central nervous system signs and symptoms, clinicians may choose to use dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid, to reduce brain edema <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para>The laboratory findings in his cerebrospinal fluid were all within normal limits. His negative Gram stain was reassuring, but false-negative Gram stains occur in cases of N. meningitidis meningitis. However, his neurologic examination was also normal with no evidence of central nervous system involvement such as stiff neck or mental status changes. The laboratory findings plus the finding on physical examination indicate that the patient did not have meningitis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The blood culture Gram stain shows a Gram-negative diplococcus consistent with N. meningitidis. The organism identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectroscopy. The most common infectious cause of petechiae and purpura (<link linkend="ch0064s0004fg02">Fig. 61.2</link>) is <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis>. The blood culture findings were consistent with the clinical findings, suggesting that the patient had fulminant meningococcal bacteremia. It is important to note that ceftriaxone is the recommended empiric therapy for <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> infections in clinical practice guidelines <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib04">(4)</link>. However, that drug could not be used because of the patient’s cephalosporin allergy. Data suggest that allergic cross-reactions between the carbapenem, meropenem, and penicillins or cephalosporins are highly unlikely, making it a good alternative agent because it has broad activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib08">(8)</link>.</para>
        <para>Once the organism was identified, it would be appropriate to de-escalate his antimicrobial therapy and discontinue both fluconazole and vancomycin.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Knowing the serogroup of the bacterial isolate and its antimicrobial susceptibility would be very helpful in managing the patient, his close contacts, and perhaps the community. <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> is spread by droplets from an infected individual to those in close contact. Meningococcal disease outbreaks can occur in congregate living situations such as college dormitories, military barracks, homeless shelters, and prisons <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib09">(9)</link>. For example, between 2008 and 2017, 13 meningococcal serogroup B outbreaks occurred on U. S. college campuses<link linkend="ch0064s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para>This particular patient was infected with meningococcal serogroup B. Being vaccinated with the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine does not protect the individual against serogroup B. Two recombinant vaccines specific for meningococcal serogroup B are available. The CDC currently recommends vaccinating individuals between 16 and 23 years old, in consultation with their health care provider, against this serogroup<link linkend="ch0064s0002bib11">(11)</link>. If there were concerns about exposures in the community, then community-wide vaccination with the serogroup B vaccine could be recommended. This strategy has been used successfully on multiple college campuses where outbreaks have occurred. Close contacts, including household members or people exposed to the infected individual’s oral secretions by kissing, sharing utensils, or drinking from the same container, would receive one oral dose of ciprofloxacin as antimicrobial prophylaxis <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para>If, however, the patient had serogroup Y meningococcus, it would change prophylaxis for close contacts. Serogroup Y isolates that produce beta-lactamase, implying resistance to penicillin and ampicillin, and are ciprofloxacin resistant have been recovered in the United States<link linkend="ch0064s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Such isolates are found globally. Because antimicrobial susceptibility testing for meningococcus is not widely available, alternative choices to ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis would be needed. Currently, the CDC recommends a course of oral rifampin or a single injection with ceftriaxone. Vaccination with the quadrivalent, conjugated meningococcal vaccine could be used for community vaccination for serogroup Y.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Because of the ability of individuals to travel anywhere in the world within 24 hours, it is important to understand the infectious disease risks such travel engenders and to take the necessary steps to reduce those risks. The “meningitis belt” is found in sub-Saharan Africa (<link linkend="ch0064s0001fg03">Fig. 61.3</link>). That region has the highest rate of invasive meningococcal disease, especially during the dry season, with localized epidemics being common <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib13">(13)</link>. The infection rate has declined in that region with the introduction of a serogroup A-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine but still is much higher than in the rest of the world <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib10">(10)</link>. The CDC recommends that travelers to this area receive the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine since the predominant serogroups there are A, C, and W. Serogroup X <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib10">(10)</link>is also being seen there, for which there are no approved U. S. vaccines<link linkend="ch0064s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>

        <para>Saudi Arabia requires vaccination with quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine within the prior 5 years for individuals attending the religious pilgrimages, Hajj and Umrah, to Mecca or for those employed during those events<link linkend="ch0064s0002bib14">(14)</link>. In particular, the Hajj attracts as many as 3 million people annually. This mass gathering brings pilgrims from all over the world, including more than 100,000 pilgrims from sub-Saharan Africa. Because individuals are in close proximity during religious services and many stay in crowded communal settings such as large tents, transmission of pathogens spread by the respiratory route is of significant concern. Outbreaks attributed to pilgrims bringing meningococcus to Mecca or taking it home from there are well documented <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib15">(15)</link>. In order to reduce this risk, vaccination is required.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>   The patient’s history was significant for three episodes of pneumonia requiring hospitalization during childhood, which is unusual. Although the etiologic agents of these three episodes were not reported in this case, pneumonia in people with immunoglobulin deficiencies is frequently due to encapsulated organisms, particularly <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> and <emphasis>Haemophilus influenzae</emphasis> type B. <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> can also cause pneumonia, but much less frequently than these two organisms. Encapsulated bacteria are resistant to phagocytosis. Anticapsular antibodies in conjugation with complement can kill encapsulated bacteria <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib16">(16)</link>. These antibodies also enhance phagocytosis of capsular bacteria via the process of opsonization. Patients with immunoglobulin deficiencies are treated with administration of pooled human immunoglobulins either intravenously or subcutaneously <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib17">(17)</link>.</para>
        <para>Complement-mediated killing is an important defense against infection with encapsulated infections, especially against invasive disease with <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Individuals with complement deficiencies are at increased risk for infection with this organism. Unlike immunoglobulin deficiencies, there are currently no treatments for complement deficiencies.</para>
        <para>The physician learned that immunoglobulin and complement deficiencies did not play a role in this patient’s infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Biologic immune modulators, including humanized monoclonal antibodies, are finding increasing clinical applications. For example, eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is specific for the C5 component of complement. When it binds to C5, it blocks the formation of the membrane cytolytic attack complex (MAC) by the alternate complement pathway, thus preventing red blood cell lysis. It is used to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. </para>
        <para>Because eculizumab blocks the formation of MAC, which is essential in complement-mediated killing of <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis>, it has been recognized that patients receiving this biologic are at 1,000-fold increased risk for invasive <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> disease <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Thus, patients receiving this monoclonal antibody are warned of an increased risk of invasive N. meningitidis infections and the need to receive meningococcal conjugate vaccine against serogroups A, C, Y, and W135 as well as the meningococcal serogroup B vaccine at least 2 weeks before the initial dose of eculizumab.</para>
        <para>A boxed warning is exactly as it sounds: a box bordered by bold black lines in the package insert of any drug with potential life-threatening consequences that warns of that risk. Despite meningococcal vaccination, patients who receive eculizumab remain at high risk for developing invasive meningococcal infection<link linkend="ch0064s0002bib19">(19)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  Approximately 20% of patients with fulminant meningococcal septicemia will have life-changing complications such as hearing loss, neurological deficits, or, as seen in this case, loss of digits and limbs <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para>The initial step in fulminant meningococcal infection is organisms binding to nasopharyngeal epithelial cells<link linkend="ch0064s0002bib20">(20)</link>. In a small percentage of individuals, meningococci cross this epithelial barrier and replicate to high levels in the bloodstream. The organism can do this because its polysaccharide capsule allows it to evade phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing, and it has the ability to obtain ferric iron, which is essential for a variety of metabolic processes, by scavenging it from the host using hemoglobin, transferrin, and lactoferrin surface receptors <link linkend="ch0064s0002bib21">(21)</link>. Once in the bloodstream, type IV pili mediate adhesion to endothelial cells, where the meningococcus grows as microcolonies. Microcolonies disrupt the tight juncture, leading to leakage of plasma from blood vessels. Large quantities of bacterial lipooligosaccharide on the surface of these microcolonies bind to Toll-like receptor 4 on lymphocytes, causing a “cytokine storm” mediated by the physiologic effects of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1α, interleukin-6, and NF-κB. These cytokines cause vasodilation and a loss of fluid from the capillary network. Simultaneously, capillary damage from large numbers of activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages along with the loss of blood pressure (hypovolemic shock) also decrease the oxygenation of major organs and tissues in the extremities, which can result in widespread necrosis, as was seen in this patient.</para>
        <para>At the same time, the cytokine storm inappropriately triggers the coagulation system in an attempt to stem the loss of blood from capillaries. This process causes the widespread depletion of clotting factors in what is known as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Damage to the endothelial cells coupled with DIC causes vascular thrombosis and leakage of red blood cells from blood vessels. This leads to petechiae and purpura (<link linkend="ch0064s0004fg02">Fig. 61.2</link>), which can be seen in 60% of adults with disseminated meningococcal disease.</para>

Routine vaccination with serogroup B vaccines is not currently recommended for the general population. In <emphasis>N. meningitis</emphasis> serogroup B outbreaks, vaccination against serogroup B and prophylactic antimicrobials are tools used to quell them. Selected immunocompromised populations may also receive this vaccine.</para>

            <para>Four <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> virulence factors play an essential role in meningococcal sepsis. <emphasis role="strong">Capsular polysaccharide</emphasis> allows the organism to evade innate immunity. Its ability to <emphasis role="strong">scavenge iron,</emphasis> an essential growth factor, allows it to grow in tissue where iron levels are not sufficient to allow growth of most bacteria. <emphasis role="strong">Type IV pili</emphasis> allow the organism to grow as microcolonies on endothelial cells, which promotes bacteremia. <emphasis role="strong">Lipooligosaccharide</emphasis> on the surface of microcolonies stimulates the production of a variety of cytokines, causing a “cytokine storm” that results in systemic inflammation leading to sepsis and DIC. DIC leads to petechia, purpura, and necrosis seen in this patient. Approximately 20% of patients with fulminant meningococcal septicemia will have life-changing complications such as hearing loss, neurological deficits, or, as seen in this case, loss of digits and limbs.</para>
