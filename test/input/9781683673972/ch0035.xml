        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Persons who inject drugs (PWIDs) are at risk for several bacterial, fungal, and viral infections <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Infectious complications range from localized wound infections to systemic disease. Localized skin and soft tissue infections due to organisms on the skin or from the environment are common. These infections are commonly due to staphylococci, streptococci, and environmental Gram-negative bacilli (including <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis> and <emphasis>Serratia marcescens</emphasis>). Further, injectable drugs may be contaminated with organisms that when introduced intravenously cause more severe infections. The contaminating organism may be in the drug supply or introduced through drug emulsion with tap water or lemon juice or by licking needles. These organisms include oral microbiota, fungi, and spore-forming bacteria like <emphasis>Bacillus</emphasis> species and <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> species (botulism and tetanus). If bacteria or fungi spread systemically, this may lead to endocarditis due to existing heart valve damage caused by particulate matter from injection drug use. PWIDs are also at risk for acquisition of blood-borne pathogens due to needle sharing, including HIV, HBV, and HCV <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Outbreaks of HIV and HCV have been described among PWIDs (<link linkend="ch0035s0002bib03">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib04">4</link>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>It is estimated that 2 million to 3 million people in the United States are infected with HCV, with ~70% of them chronically infected (i. e., HCV RNA detected in blood)<link linkend="ch0035s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Globally, the incidence of HCV is higher in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib06">(6)</link>. More than 58 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV, and 1.5 million new infections occur annually. The number of HCV infections has increased 364% in four states greatly impacted by the opioid epidemic (Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia) <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Beginning in 2018, adults in their 20s and 30s comprised &gt;36% of the newly reported chronic HCV infections, largely due to injection drug use. HCV infection is the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States.</para>
        <para>Approximately 15 to 30% of patients with HCV have an asymptomatic or mild infection that resolves spontaneously<link linkend="ch0035s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Rarely, fulminant acute hepatitis with liver failure and death occurs with primary HCV infection, and chronic HBV carriage has been shown to be a risk factor. Acute infection occurs most often in the 20- to 39-year age group. Most individuals (70 to 85%) progress to develop chronic infection that, if left untreated, may evolve over decades from persistent chronic hepatitis to hepatic fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis and potentially to liver failure and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Both chronic alcohol use and HIV infection may accelerate the natural history of liver disease.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  There are five major modes of transmission recognized for HCV: (i) sharing needles, syringes, or drug-preparing utensils during the injection of drugs; (ii) transfusions of unscreened blood products; (iii) needlestick injuries or mucous membrane exposure of blood from an HCV-infected individual; (iv) sexually; and (v) vertical transmission from mother to baby <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib09">(9)</link>. In addition, HCV has been transmitted by tattooing and body piercing performed in unregulated settings <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib10">(10)</link>. The major mode of HCV transmission in the United States and other industrialized countries is injection drug use. Up to 75% of PWIDs are HCV seropositive <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Given that this patient was a PWID, he was mostly likely infected by sharing drug paraphernalia with an HCV-infected individual. Prior to 1992 and the development of serologic screening tests for HCV, blood transfusion was a major mode of transmission. With the introduction of nucleic acid testing of blood products in 1999, the incidence of HCV transmission by blood transfusion in the United States has dropped to ~1 in 2 million. Another at-risk group are patients with hemophilia who received clotting factor preparations prior to 1987 (when heat treatment of clotting factor preparations began). Although HCV can be spread sexually, its transmission is inefficient compared with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, including HBV. As with HIV, sexual transmission is more efficient from males to females, and individuals with multiple partners are at greater risk of infection. Exposure of health care personnel to the blood of HCV-infected individuals via needlestick or sharps injuries or mucous membrane exposures carries a 3% risk of infection, which is 10-fold less than the risk for acquiring HBV infection but 10-fold greater than the risk for acquiring HIV infection. Vertical transmission of HCV from an infected mother occurs infrequently and is more likely from mothers who are concurrently infected with HIV. About 4% of babies born to HCV-positive mothers become infected. The virus does not appear to be transmitted via breast milk.</para>
        <para>Since many chronically infected individuals are viremic and asymptomatic for years, screening for HCV infection in at-risk populations has become an important tool to prevent transmission. Many HCV-infected persons are not aware of their infection, and 45% do not recall a potential exposure. In 2012, the CDC recommended that all adults born from 1945 to 1965 be tested for HCV independent of risk factors. This population has a disproportionately high prevalence of HCV infection and related disease. Currently, CDC recommends universal hepatitis C screening; all adults ≥18 years old should be screened at least once in their lifetime<link linkend="ch0035s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Further, periodic testing should be performed for at-risk populations. This includes PWIDs, any individual who has been on long-term hemodialysis, and anyone with persistently abnormal AST levels. Further, individuals whose blood was the source in a needlestick or sharps or mucosal exposure should be tested for HCV. If the source person is HCV positive, the exposed health care or public safety worker should be tested and should have follow-up testing at 4 to 6 months. Children born to HCV-positive women should be tested for HCV RNA until 6 months of age. HCV testing can be considered for the following persons, though the need to do so is uncertain: recipients of transplanted tissue, non-injecting illegal drug users, persons with tattoos or body piercings, persons with a history of multiple sexual partners or sexually transmitted infections, and long-term steady sexual partners of HCV-positive persons.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>   The strategy for diagnosing HCV is to detect HCV-specific antibodies by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by a confirmatory test (<link linkend="ch0035s0001fg01">Fig. 32.1</link>). Newer-generation EIA tests are highly sensitive, detecting about 97% of HCV-infected patients and becoming positive by 8 weeks postinfection. Since serologic tests detect total anti-HCV (immunoglobulin M [IgM] and IgG), they cannot distinguish between acute, chronic, or resolved infections. Specificities for serologic tests range from 94 to 100%; therefore, confirmatory testing is recommended. The CDC recommends that EIA-positive specimens be tested for HCV RNA to determine the status of infection (<link linkend="ch0035s0001fg01">Fig. 32.1</link>) <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Further, RNA testing can be useful in acute infections before the patient develops an antibody response. However, since most patients present for medical care in the chronic phase of HCV infection, when they are seropositive, detection of HCV RNA is rarely used as a primary diagnostic tool.</para>
        <para>Quantitative RNA NAATs, or viral loads, are also used to monitor response to therapy. Historically, both qualitative and quantitative tests have been used because the qualitative tests had lower limits of detection than the quantitative tests. However, with real-time PCR, quantitative tests are as sensitive as, or more sensitive than, qualitative tests, detecting as few as 12 IU/ml. Therefore, most laboratories use highly sensitive quantitative real-time NAAT for viral load monitoring. HCV viral load testing is performed at baseline prior to starting therapy and at 12 weeks or more after completion of therapy to determine SVR<link linkend="ch0035s0002bib14">(14)</link>. A “not detected” (i. e., negative) HCV viral load at least 12 weeks after therapy completion (SVR12) is consistent with cure of chronic HCV infection.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  The standard therapy for HCV for many years was combination therapy with pegylated interferon (IFN) α-2a or -2b (PegIFN) and ribavirin. However, in 2011, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) were first approved by the FDA <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Multiple classes of DAAs are now available, which have replaced PegIFN/ribavirin therapy. Currently, there are six FDA-approved DAAs for the treatment of HCV, five of which are combination therapies <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Drug classes include NS5B polymerase inhibitors, NS5A (nonstructural protein) inhibitors, and NS3/4A (protease) inhibitors <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib17">(17)</link>. The therapy this patient received was a combination of two drugs. Glecaprevir is an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and pibrentasvir is an NS5A inhibitor. It is approved for treatment of all HCV genotypes and for patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. In clinical trials, 95 to 99.7% of patients with genotype 1 or 3 achieved SVR12 with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib18">(18)</link>. In general, the combination DAAs cure &gt;95% of HCV chronic infections <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Unfortunately, the cost of DAAs is a barrier to equitable access to HCV therapy. The list price for 1 month of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is $13,200, and it is generally prescribed for 2 months <link linkend="ch0035s0002bib20">(20)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>The two main possibilities are that (i) his initial HCV infection was not adequately treated or (ii) he was reinfected with HCV. The patient was compliant and completed the full 8 weeks of therapy, but a viral load at least 12 weeks after therapy completion to assess SVR was not performed. Even though his viral load after 4 weeks of therapy was not detected (i. e., rapid virologic response), resistance could have developed during therapy. The most clinically relevant resistance-associated mutations are in NS5A<link linkend="ch0035s0002bib21">(21)</link>. Viruses with mutations in NS5B and NS3/4A exist, but these viruses seem to be less fit. A sequencing-based assay to look for known resistance-associated mutations should be performed on his current HCV RNA-positive specimen. Detection of resistance will not definitively prove his initial HCV infection was inadequately treated, as he could have acquired a new HCV infection with resistance mutations. However, resistance testing is important because it will inform appropriate therapy for his current HCV infection.</para>
        <para>HCV reinfection (and infection with multiple HCV strains/genotypes) is common in PWIDs<link linkend="ch0035s0002bib22">(22)</link>. Although the patient is said to be in remission from his substance abuse disorder, we cannot rule out that he injected drugs, or had a different exposure, since his last HCV infection. HCV genotyping should be performed with either a NAAT- or sequencing-based assay. Prior to DAA-based therapy, routine HCV genotyping was important for disease prognosis and to predict response to therapy. Although many of the DAAs are approved for all HCV genotypes now, some insurers still require genotyping results. In the United States and Europe, genotype 1 is most common, followed by types 2 and 3. Genotype 4 is found in the Middle East and North Africa, genotype 5 is found in South Africa, and genotype 6 is found in Asia with a high prevalence in Hong Kong. If the patient’s genotype differs between his initial and current HCV infection, then reinfection is likely. However, if they are the same genotype, it still does not rule out reinfection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  The patient’s current HCV infection, like his initial infection, is due to genotype 3. A resistance mutation was detected in NS5A, which possibly results in a resistant phenotype for pibrentasvir, which was one the drugs in his initial combination therapy. Given that resistance to pibrentasvir is a possibility, he was treated with a triple combination drug that is often used for patients who have failed initial DAA therapy. Two of the three drugs in the combination therapy (sofosbuvir and voxilaprevir) do not have resistance mutations, while one (velpatasvir) might be affected by the NS5A mutation detected. These results do not clarify whether his HCV developed resistance during his initial treatment or if he was reinfected. However, he was tested for HIV and HBV again after his HCV-positive result and was HBV surface antigen positive. His acquisition of HBV since his initial HCV diagnosis and treatment 3 years ago suggests that he likely injected drugs in the interim, which puts him at risk for reinfection with HCV.</para>
