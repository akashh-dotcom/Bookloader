      <para>A decade has passed since the fourth edition of this book, and in that time, the field of microbiology and infectious diseases has continued to evolve. From advances in diagnostics and therapeutics to global pandemics and the ongoing battle against antimicrobial resistance, our understanding of infectious diseases continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. With this fifth edition, we aim to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of real-world cases that reflect the current landscape of microbiology and infectious diseases. Our goal is to present clinically relevant cases and provide insights into the diagnostic and therapeutic advancements shaping the future of infectious disease management.</para>
      <para>In the last 10 years, we have witnessed remarkable progress in diagnostics, with rapid molecular testing, at-home testing, next-generation sequencing, and total laboratory automation in microbiology laboratories revolutionizing how we identify pathogens. Additionally, the development of new antimicrobial agents, including the emergence of phage therapy, has brought renewed focus to the escalating threat of antimicrobial resistance. The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped global health care, exposing both the strengths and vulnerabilities of our infectious disease infrastructure. As we publish this edition, the looming threat of an H5 influenza pandemic reminds us that vigilance and preparedness remain critical.</para>
      <para>We must also address the growing challenges of misinformation and the erosion of public trust in science. Social media have facilitated the rapid dissemination of both critical health information and dangerous falsehoods. The resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, driven by misinformation and vaccine hesitancy, serves as a stark reminder that our battle is not only against microbes but also against the forces that undermine evidence-based medicine. As clinicians and educators, we must work to ensure that science prevails.</para>
      <para>We are excited to welcome two new authors to this edition, Drs. Andrea Prinzi and Kyle Rodino, who bring fresh perspectives and expertise. We thank Dr. Dan Shapiro for his contributions to the first four editions. We especially wish to express our deepest gratitude to Dr. Peter Gilligan, whose vision and dedication were essential in creating this book. As this marks his final edition as an author, we celebrate his extraordinary contributions to the field and his unwavering commitment to education. His legacy will continue to inspire all who use this book as a resource in their pursuit of knowledge.</para>
      <para>We hope that this edition serves as a valuable tool for learners at all levels and reinforces the critical role of microbiology and infectious diseases in shaping global health. As the field continues to advance, so must our collective knowledge and commitment to scientific integrity. The challenges ahead are significant, but with curiosity, collaboration, and perseverance, we remain confident that we will rise to meet them.</para>
