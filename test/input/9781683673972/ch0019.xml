      <sect1 id="ch0019s0004"><title>CASE 16</title><para>A 26-year-old male from Pennsylvania with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of a fever, nausea, headache, and fatigue. The patient also reported having six episodes of non-bloody dark, brown-colored diarrhea, shortness of breath, and persistent cough over 2 days prior to arriving at the ED. The patient reported taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Motrin) but experienced no relief.</para>
      <para>Upon physical exam, the patient was positive for nasal congestion but negative for rhinorrhea and a sore throat. Examination of his eyes was negative for any visual disturbance. The patient was experiencing a cough and shortness of breath but had no wheezing or chest pain. Additionally, he had no rash, arthralgia, myalgia, dizziness, weakness, or light-headedness. He was febrile with a temperature of 39°C, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 to 20 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on ambulation. Blood chemistry tests demonstrated a mildly elevated pH of 7.52 and a mildly low potassium at 3.4 mmol/liter, but the patient had received 2 liters of intravenous fluids. Lactic acid and lipase levels were normal. The patient’s complete blood count was within normal limits.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Given the patient’s respiratory symptoms and fever, pneumonia should be one of the primary conditions included in the differential diagnosis and should be differentiated from milder forms of respiratory disease like an upper respiratory tract infection. Many pathogens can cause CAP, and disease can range from mild to severe requiring hospitalization and intensive care <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The most common bacterial causes of CAP include <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis</emphasis>, and members of the <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>. Existing comorbidities and risk factors should be considered as the risk of infection with certain bacteria will differ based on these factors. For example, the elderly and children in daycare centers are at an increased risk of infection with drug-resistant <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. With the increased use of syndromic molecular tests, viral etiologies have been increasingly implicated in cases of CAP. Common viral pathogens include rhinovirus, influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. Finally, “atypical bacteria,” or organisms that are difficult to culture and not apparent on Gram stain, are common causes of CAP <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib03">(3)</link>. These organisms include <emphasis>M. pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Legionella</emphasis> species. While lower on the differential list, intra-abdominal pathologies and gastrointestinal disease should be considered in this patient, given the history of diarrhea. Finally, since the patient had a fever and nausea, a urinary tract infection must be considered.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> is a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Infection with <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> is most common during winter months but can occur at any time year-round. While tracheobronchitis is the most common, pneumonia is the most severe clinical manifestation of <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection, and the organism is the most common cause of atypical pneumonia in the United States <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib05">(5)</link>. During outbreaks, <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> can cause pneumonia in up to 70% of cases. There is a lack of point-of-care diagnostic tests or formal surveillance infrastructure for <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis>, so the true incidence of infection is unknown and is likely underestimated. Still, available data on <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection epidemiology demonstrate that school-age children and adolescents are the most affected, although infection may occur across all age groups.</para>
        <para><emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> is a bacterium without a cell wall that requires host epithelial cells to survive. The organism must adhere to epithelial cells, a process known as cytadherence, to access nutrients and evade the host immune response. Other organism-specific factors associated with virulence include sialic acid-modified proteins, sulfated glycopeptides, and gliding motility across the surface of epithelial cells. In addition to adherence to epithelial cells, gliding motility is essential for <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> virulence and is associated with cell division and infection spreading. Hydrogen peroxide production is another important virulence factor, and laboratory studies have demonstrated decreased cytotoxicity to host cells in mutant strains of <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> that could not produce hydrogen peroxide.</para>
        <para>A <emphasis>Mycoplasma</emphasis>-specific molecule called community-acquired respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) toxin is another significant virulence factor that is a disease determinant. The CARDS molecule is inactive when it enters the host epithelial cell by way of the M. pneumoniae organism, but once activated within the host cell’s endoplasmic reticulum, it leverages the cell’s existing machinery and executes cytotoxicity <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib06">(6)</link>. The combination of virulence factors and epithelial cell invasion results in host inflammatory and immune responses that manifest in the clinical presentation of a persistent hacking cough. The production of cytokines and lymphocyte activation in the host may eliminate <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> or may worsen the damage, resulting in more severe pulmonary injury. Furthermore, recent animal study research demonstrates that infection severity is further influenced by age, gender, genetic background, and environmental stress <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  As was seen in this patient’s case, symptoms of <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection may be nonspecific and mimic other respiratory tract infections. Symptoms commonly include headache, fever, malaise, and a nagging cough <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Patients will most often present with tracheobronchitis, and 5 to 10% of patients will progress to pneumonia. In some cases, <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection can cause extrapulmonary disease, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, acute hepatitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, arthritis, and transverse myelitis. Cardiac manifestations are some of the most frequently reported extrapulmonary complications associated with <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Pericarditis and endocarditis are believed to be caused by direct infection with the organism, and it has been detected from pericardial fluid and tissue as well as the blood of infected patients. As <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infects the heart tissue, a cytokine response is induced, resulting in severe inflammation at the site of infection. The mechanism for myocarditis caused by <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection is less clear but is believed to be a result of autoimmunity. In rare cases, hypercoagulability has been reported in patients with <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection, resulting in cardiac and aortic thrombi <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Central nervous system (CNS) complications are the most difficult to identify and can be severe. Research on the cause of <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis>-associated CNS disease demonstrates that manifestations stem from three primary mechanisms: direct type of nervous system damage, indirect type of nervous system damage, and vascular type of nervous system damage <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib09">(9)</link>. In the case of direct nervous system damage, <emphasis>M. pneumoniae </emphasis>moves from the respiratory tract into the CNS, adhering to the glycoproteins and glycolipids of target cells. Once there, it causes immediate damage. While the mechanisms of direct CNS damage are not well understood, researchers believe that the initiation of the host’s immune response paired with the inability of the immune system to clear <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> adhesions play a role in the host’s neurological disease. In contrast to direct CNS damage, indirect CNS damage occurs several days after the onset of <emphasis>M. pneumoniae </emphasis>disease. Indirect CNS damage is primarily a result of autoimmunity, a result of molecular mimicry between <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> components and glycolipids present on the host’s myelin <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Anti-<emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> antibodies that cross-react with host myelin can be detected in the spinal fluid and serum of patients with late-onset CNS manifestations. It is important to note that antibodies may be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid even if <emphasis>M. pneumoniae </emphasis>DNA is not, further supporting the notion that late-onset CNS disease associated with <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> is indirect. Vascular type damage occurs as a result of the cytokine response induced by <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection, which often results in local vascular occlusions or a system hypercoagulable state.</para>
        <para>Finally, acute myositis is a known complication of atypical pneumonia and can occur after infection with <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib10">(10)</link>. While the mechanisms of <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis>-associated myositis are not known, case studies that included a muscle biopsy from affected patients demonstrated invasion of the organism in the skeletal muscle, suggesting direct damage by the pathogen, or local cytokine release in the muscle tissue.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Many patients infected with <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> present in the outpatient setting and do not receive diagnostic testing since they can often be successfully treated using empiric antimicrobial therapy for CAP. Laboratory tests (except for specific microbiologic assays) are generally nondiagnostic in people with mild disease and often result in normal complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver and kidney function levels. This explains why the patient’s initial blood test results were unremarkable. In patients with more severe disease, inflammatory markers may be elevated, and approximately 50% of patients are positive for cold agglutinins. Cold agglutinins are autoantibodies directed against the I antigen found on red blood cells, and the presence of these autoantibodies can lead to life-threatening anemia, particularly in patients with underlying hemolytic disease <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Cold agglutinin titers may be helpful in some patients, but this test is not specific to <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Mycoplasma</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> and can be positive in patients with viral pneumonia <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib05">(5)</link>. As was seen in this patient, the most common chest radiograph finding in people infected with <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> is patchy consolidations, most often occurring in the lower lobe. However, these findings are not specific enough to differentiate <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection from other types of atypical pneumonia. Because <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> does not have a cell wall, it is not visible by Gram stain, and it is difficult to culture. Specialized laboratories can perform culture using special media, but the process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring anywhere from 7 to 21 days for growth. Serologic testing is available with adequate sensitivity and specificity but requires multiple specimen collections over time. NAAT testing is sensitive, specific, rapid, and the test of choice.</para>
        <para>This patient had a nasopharyngeal swab collected and sent for testing using a syndromic respiratory multiplex NAAT panel, which was positive only for <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis>. While many medical centers use a multiplex NAAT to detect <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis>, single-analyte assays are also available. It is important to note that asymptomatic carriage is common, particularly in children, and often precedes <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> infection. In a study of asymptomatic carriage in children and their household contacts, carriage was as high as 47% in siblings without infection and 27% in parents without infection <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Additionally, in children with recurrent infections, carriage rates reached 69%. Positive results, particularly sensitive assays such as NAATs, should always be interpreted in the context of clinical signs and symptoms.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>   Patients with <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> are often successfully treated with the empiric therapy recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society’s treatment guidelines for CAP <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib01">(1)</link>. For outpatient adults without comorbidities, the following regimens are recommended: 1 g of amoxicillin three times daily or 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily or a macrolide (e. g., azithromycin or clarithromycin) at differing doses and intervals depending on drug choice. For outpatient adults with comorbidities, combination therapy is often recommended, including amoxicillin-clavulanate or a cephalosporin in combination with a macrolide or doxycycline. Alternatively, a respiratory fluoroquinolone can be used as monotherapy. While beta-lactams may be recommended therapy for other causes of CAP, they are not appropriate for the treatment of <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> or other atypical CAP organisms due to the lack of a cell wall <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib13">(13)</link>.</para>
        <para>This patient was initially started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin, presumably to cover for other bacterial infections in addition to CAP. The use of a third-generation cephalosporin is not recommended for empiric therapy for CAP. Still, the patient’s nonspecific abdominal and gastrointestinal symptoms may have played a role in the clinician’s decision to prescribe ceftriaxone. Although the patient’s discharge prescription for azithromycin for a total of 10 days indicated he had a severe infection, he did not meet the clinical criteria for severe CAP. For patients without comorbidities or severe CAP, 5 days of therapy is generally considered sufficient<link linkend="ch0019s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para>Macrolide resistance rates among <emphasis>M. pneumoniae</emphasis> isolates have increased since the early 2000s. The resistance rate in the United States is estimated to be approximately 10%, whereas resistance rates are as high as 90% in Asia. The CDC recommends the judicious use of antimicrobials, including macrolides, to preserve their efficacy and help prevent the development of antimicrobial-resistant organisms <link linkend="ch0019s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>
        <para>It is important to note that the use of comprehensive rapid diagnostic testing may have significantly reduced the amount of time the patient spent in the ED. Rapid syndromic molecular tests offer significantly reduced turnaround times, and may support reduced hospital stays as well as targeted antimicrobial therapy<link linkend="ch0019s0002bib15">(15)</link>.</para>
