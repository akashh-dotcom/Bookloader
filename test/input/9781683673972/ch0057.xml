        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>This patient’s critical illness, number of invasive procedures including ventilator dependence and number of indwelling lines (e. g., central venous catheter), and various antibiotic courses are risk factors for HAIs. Specifically, this patient’s lifesaving interventions present the risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, and surgical site infection. This patient was also at risk of developing <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> infection due to recent antibiotic exposure, age (≥65), and extensive contact with health care <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  It is recommended that <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species are not reported specifically and instead reported as “yeast” with further identification only by request <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib02">(2)</link>. However, <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis>, <emphasis>Geotrichum</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Trichosporon</emphasis> recovered from urine cultures should be reported to at least the genus level. Antifungal susceptibility testing is not routinely performed when yeasts are isolated from urine. While non-<emphasis>auris Candida</emphasis> species may not be reported clinically from nonsterile culture sites, identifying yeast isolates to “passively screen” for <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> can be a beneficial infection prevention tool, particularly for inpatients <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> is a yeast that has emerged as a global health threat over the course of the last decade and may be multidrug resistant. The first documented isolation of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> occurred in 2009 in Japan <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Since then, it has been isolated all over the globe, with the first reported U. S. case occurring in New York<link linkend="ch0057s0002bib05">(5)</link>. In 2023, there were more than 4,500 documented clinical cases of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>, with Nevada, California, Florida, New York, Illinois, and Texas reporting the most <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib06">(6)</link>. The rapid rise and immediate threat of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> have been noted in the 2019 CDC Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report and the 2022 WHO Fungal Priority List (<link linkend="ch0057s0002bib07">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib08">8</link>). It has been postulated that the emergence of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> as a pathogen is a result of global warming <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib09">(9)</link>. With the adaptation of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> to rising temperatures in its natural habitat, it acquired a tolerance to animal body temperature, which resulted in the ability to colonize and spread in new populations. <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> is most closely related to <emphasis>C. duobushaemulonii</emphasis>, <emphasis>C. pseudohaemulonii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>C. haemulonii</emphasis>, all rarely encountered <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species of limited pathogenic potential <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib10">(10)</link>. There are five recognized clades of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>, emerging from distinct geographic regions, all of which have been detected in the United States. Clade I is the most commonly encountered in the United States, but local outbreaks are largely dependent on the mode of introduction <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib11">(11)</link>.</para>
        <para><emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> presents a significant infection prevention concern due to its unique abilities to persist in the hospital environment and resist disinfection. Studies have shown that <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> can remain viable on surfaces for weeks <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Additionally, <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> can be resistant to commonly used disinfection products, including quaternary ammonia compounds. Recommendations for disinfection include the use of products on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) list “P” <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib13">(13)</link>, which are products with specific claims for activity against <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>(e. g., containing sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide) or, if unavailable, EPA list “K” with <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>spore activity (e. g., containing sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide)<link linkend="ch0057s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Together, these features of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> contribute to the possibility of environment-to-patient transmission within the health care facility.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Risk factors for <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> colonization include a known epidemiological link to a patient infected with <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>, admission at a facility with known <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> circulation, or frequent contact with health care, specifically long-term acute care facilities or ventilator-capable skilled nursing facilities <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Invasive procedures or lifesaving measures, such as indwelling medical devices or central lines, increase the risk of infection. Colonization with <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> increases the risk that patients will progress to invasive infection <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib16">(16)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  CDC recommends screening patients with the risk factors described in <phrase>answer 4</phrase> for <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> colonization <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Identification of colonized patients can be helpful in implementing the correct infection prevention control measures, namely contact precautions, and directing <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>-specific terminal cleaning of the patient room. Active surveillance for <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> colonization can be done by culture or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib17">(17)</link>. A combined swab of the axilla and groin can be plated directly to a salt/dulcitol-containing agar or enriched in a salt/dulcitol broth prior to plating. These conditions selectively grow <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> over other <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>species. Chromogenic media, e. g., CHROMagar <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> Plus, can also be used for isolation and differentiation of <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species, including <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>. NAAT testing uses the same sample type and is preferred to culture in terms of speed and throughput. Broth preenrichment can improve sensitivity of NAAT screening.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  <link linkend="ch0057s0004fg01">Figure 54.1</link> shows small oval budding yeasts in the Gram stain from the blood culture bottles. This morphology is most consistent with <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable method for identification of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> when using up-to-date databases. Misidentification of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> as other yeast species has been reported when using other semiautomated or phenotypic identification methods <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Molecular methods, such as rapid blood culture yeast identification panels and 28S D1/D2 or internal transcribed spacer sequencing, have been shown to be reliable as well. Special chromogenic agars with the ability to differentiate <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> can provide rapid, culture-based discrimination.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Azole resistance of <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis> is extremely common, &gt;90%, and azoles are considered ineffective <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Resistance to amphotericin B is also common, particularly in clade I, the most common clade encountered in the United States. Resistance to echinocandins is infrequent, but pan-resistant isolates have been reported. There are currently no established interpretive criteria of antifungal susceptibility testing for <emphasis>C. auris</emphasis>. Tentative breakpoints, based on criteria used for other <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> species, may be used to interpret MICs and assist in choice of therapy <link linkend="ch0057s0002bib20">(20)</link>.</para>
