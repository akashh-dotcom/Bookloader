    </title>
    <sect1 id="ch0002s0002"><title>A PRIMER ON THE LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES</title><para>Accurately diagnosing infectious diseases often requires diagnostic tests to identify their cause, although this is not always the case. In managed care environments, the use of these diagnostic tests is carefully monitored and typically guided by standardized care protocols known as “clinical pathways” or “clinical care algorithms.” These pathways consist of a specific set of diagnostic tests for patients presenting symptoms associated with specific clinical conditions, such as community-acquired pneumonia. Currently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has published over 30 practice guidelines addressing various infectious diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, diarrheal diseases, and pneumonia. Clinical pathways can be developed from these guidelines. Clinical pathways and practice guidelines are components of “evidence-based medicine,” which relies on reviewing and interpreting data from medical literature to inform clinical decision-making.</para>
    <para>In some patients, such as a healthy child with a rash typical of varicella (chickenpox), the cause of the infection can often be determined with a high degree of certainty through physical examination alone. In this situation, conducting diagnostic tests may be considered an unnecessary expense in health care. Conversely, a 4-year-old who presents with enlarged cervical lymph nodes and a sore throat should undergo diagnostic testing to confirm whether they have pharyngitis caused by group A streptococci. This testing is crucial because certain viral syndromes can be clinically indistinguishable from group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Since group A streptococcal pharyngitis requires antibiotic treatment to prevent poststreptococcal complications, and viral infections do not respond to antibiotics, identifying the infection's cause is essential for appropriate patient care.</para>
    <para>Unfortunately, antibiotics are often prescribed without diagnostic testing for children with sore throats. As a result, many children with viral pharyngitis receive antibiotics unnecessarily. This improper use of antibiotics increases selective pressure for antibiotic resistance among organisms in the throat's resident microbiota, such as <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>. Additionally, patients may suffer from antibiotic-related complications, including mild to severe allergic reactions or gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea. This is just one of many examples where diagnostic test results can inform clinical management and prevent undesirable downstream consequences.</para>
    <para>One of the goals of this edition is to encourage an evidence-informed and cost-effective approach to utilizing laboratory resources. As an introduction, we will provide a general overview of the various laboratory methods used in the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases.</para>

      <title><emphasis role="color1">ACCURACY IN LABORATORY TESTING</emphasis>
      </title>
      <para>The clinical microbiology laboratory must balance the need for timely results with the requirement for accuracy. Thinking about the balance between test accuracy, pretest probability, and test interpretation is best done through a tool called Fagan's nomogram. Fagan's nomogram provides a graphical method to quantify how much a test result changes the probability of disease, helping clinicians make informed decisions based on test results. In the context of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), Fagan's nomogram can be used to assess the reliability of AST results by considering the likelihood ratios associated with resistance detection methods. For example, if a rapid AST method has a high positive likelihood ratio (LR+), a resistant result significantly increases the probability that the pathogen is truly resistant, guiding clinicians toward effective alternative therapies. Conversely, a high negative likelihood ratio (LR−) for a susceptibility test would strongly suggest that resistance is unlikely, supporting the use of first-line antibiotics. Using Fagan's nomogram in AST and other laboratory tests is particularly useful when test sensitivity and specificity are not perfect. For example, molecular resistance detection methods, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for β-lactamase or carbapenemase genes, may yield false-positive or false-negative results depending on the gene targets included. Fagan's nomogram helps assess how much confidence a clinician should place in a test result based on the pretest probability of resistance in a given patient population. This is especially relevant in settings with emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where knowing the true probability of resistance is crucial for antibiotic stewardship and optimizing patient outcomes. By applying Bayesian reasoning in a simple, visual format, Fagan's nomogram enhances decision-making in clinical microbiology and infectious disease management (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg01">Fig. 1</ulink>).</para>
      <para>Another example of the balance between test accuracy and the rapid release of results is seen in identification methods. Consider the identification of a Gram-negative bacillus from a clinical specimen. When using a commercially available identification system, both the identification and an assessment of the confidence level will be based on biochemical test results compared to a database. If the results indicate that the organism is <emphasis>Enterobacter cloacae</emphasis> with a 92% probability, the laboratory may decide to report this identification. However, it's important to recognize that even with a 92% accuracy rate—as may often be the case with commercial systems that struggle with anaerobic bacteria—there's still an 8% chance, or approximately 1 in 12, that this identification could be incorrect. Although the laboratory could conduct additional testing to enhance certainty about the identification, such actions could lead to delays in reporting results, which may be clinically significant. In some instances, such delays are unavoidable, especially when the identification from the commercial system falls below an acceptable probability threshold and additional identification methods are required. For specific cases, such as identifying <emphasis>Brucella</emphasis> spp., manual identification methods are preferred due to risks to laboratory staff and inaccuracies of many automated systems.</para>

      <para>The methods commonly used in clinical laboratories for AST have notable limitations. The most significant errors occur when a laboratory mistakenly reports an organism as susceptible to an antibiotic when it is, in fact, resistant. To mitigate this risk, additional tests are sometimes conducted. For instance, standard testing for <emphasis>Enterococcus</emphasis> may be supplemented with agar containing a known concentration of vancomycin. Even if the standard susceptibility test shows that the organism is susceptible to vancomycin, growth on the vancomycin-containing agar plate would lead to a report of resistant to vancomycin.</para>
      <para>Typically, automated AST methods have a delay in identifying newly discovered mechanisms of AMR, which often necessitates the use of manual testing methods. The performance of AST can vary, and certain combinations of organisms and antibiotics can exhibit unacceptably high error rates. In these cases, backup methods, such as disk diffusion or gradient diffusion (Etest), should be used. Laboratories that perform a large volume of susceptibility tests tend to prefer automated methods due to the labor-intensive nature of manual testing and the quicker reporting of results—often in just a few hours compared to the overnight incubation required for manual methods.</para>
      <para>Diagnostic tests also vary in sensitivity and specificity. For example, in a hypothetical sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic, the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test—a screening tool for syphilis—might be evaluated in 1,000 patients with genital ulcer disease who are suspected of having primary syphilis.</para>
      <figure id="ch0002s0001fg02"><title/>
        
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>Based on these data, the sensitivity of this test (the true-positive rate, calculated as true-positive results divided by the number of patients with disease) in primary syphilis is 66%. The specificity (1 minus the false-positive rate) is 83%. Note that in this high-prevalence population (the prevalence here is the total number of cases in which primary syphilis is present—640 divided by the total number of individuals, 1,000—and is thus 0.64, or 64%), the predictive value of a positive test is fairly good, at 88%. The positive predictive value of an assay varies with the prevalence of the disease in the population. This is a key point. Changing our syphilis serology example to a low-prevalence population will serve to illustrate the point.</para>
      <para>The same RPR serologic assay is being used in a hypothetical population of octogenarian nuns, none of whom are or have been sexually active in at least 6 decades.</para>
      <figure id="ch0002s0001fg03"><title/>
        
        <mediaobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>In this patient population, there is only one true case of syphilis, presumably acquired many years previously. The specificity of the test in this patient population is the same as it is in the individuals attending the STI clinic (in reality, it is likely to be different in different populations and also in different stages of syphilis). Because there is one case of syphilis, and 169 of the positive RPR results are false-positive test results, the positive predictive value in this patient population is only 0.6%. Clearly, this is a patient population in which the decision to test for syphilis using the RPR assay is not cost-effective.</para>
      <para>In deciding to order a specific test, the physician should know what they will do with the test results—essentially, how the results will alter the patient's care. In a patient who is unlikely to have a specific disease, and who receives a test that has an appreciable rate of false-positive results, a positive test result is likely to be false positive and should not alter clinical care. Conversely, if the physician is certain that a patient has a disease, there is no good reason to order a test with a low sensitivity, as a negative result will likely be false negative. Tests are best used when there is uncertainty and when the results will alter the posttest probability and, therefore, the management of the patient.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">SPECIMEN SELECTION, COLLECTION, AND TRANSPORT</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para>Each laboratory test has three stages.</para>
        <orderedlist id="ch0002s0001l01" role="decimal">
          <listitem id="ch0002s0001x01">
            <para>Preanalytical Stage: This is the first and most error-prone phase, encompassing all steps before the actual test is performed. It includes test selection, patient identification, specimen collection, handling, transportation, and preparation. Errors in this stage, such as mislabeling, improper storage, or contamination, can compromise test accuracy and lead to incorrect diagnoses or treatment decisions.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0002s0001x02">
            <para>Analytical Stage: This phase involves the actual testing and measurement of analytes using various laboratory techniques. It includes quality control (QC), instrument calibration, and assay performance to ensure precision and accuracy. Errors in this stage are less common due to automation and standardization, but they can still occur due to reagent issues, equipment malfunctions, or operator errors.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0002s0001x03">
            <para>Postanalytical Stage: This final phase focuses on interpreting, validating, and reporting results to clinicians. It includes data review, result verification, and timely communication to ensure the findings are correctly conveyed to guide patient care. Delays in reporting or misinterpretation of results can impact clinical decisions and patient outcomes.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>The preanalytical stage is the most crucial part of laboratory testing. If the wrong test is ordered, the wrong specimen is collected, the specimen is labeled with the incorrect patient's name, or the correct specimen is improperly transported, the microbe causing the patient's illness may not be detected during the analytical stage. Additionally, the preanalytical phase includes the patient's clinical presentation and associated pretest probability, which play a significant role in interpreting test results. For example, collecting a sample from a patient with a low pretest probability is unlikely to yield useful information. Consequently, during the postanalytical stage, the caregiver may not have the necessary information to make an accurate therapeutic decision. A common saying in laboratory medicine is “garbage in, garbage out.” Specimen selection is vital. A patient exhibiting fever, chills, and malaise may have an infection in various organ systems. For instance, if a patient has a urinary tract infection and urine is not collected for culture, the source and cause of the infection may be overlooked. Careful history-taking and physical examination are essential for selecting the correct specimen.</para>
        <para>Continuing with the example of a patient with a fever due to a urinary tract infection, the next step in diagnosing the infection is collecting a urine specimen. Since the urethra contains resident microbiota, urine specimens are typically not sterile. A well-collected urine specimen involves cleansing the external genitalia and collecting midstream urine. This method is important because the initial part of the stream flushes away much of the urethral microbiota. However, despite meticulous attention to detail, clean-catch urine can still be contaminated with urethral microbiota, which may render the specimen uninterpretable during the postanalytical stage.</para>
        <para>When transporting clinical specimens for culture, it is essential to recognize that they contain living organisms whose viability is affected by transport conditions. These organisms may be harmed by changes in temperature, drying out, exposure to oxygen, lack of vital nutrients, or alterations in specimen pH. Therefore, transport conditions should be established to support the viability of clinically significant organisms present in the specimen. Additionally, it is crucial to note that the longer the transportation time, the less likely the viability of these organisms will be maintained. Rapid transport of specimens is essential for maximum accuracy during the analytical stage.</para>
        <para>The clinical microbiology laboratory should be a leader in what is known as diagnostic stewardship. Diagnostic stewardship is a critical component of high-quality patient care, ensuring that laboratory tests are ordered appropriately, performed accurately, and interpreted correctly to guide optimal clinical decision-making. In the context of clinical microbiology, diagnostic stewardship helps prevent unnecessary testing, reduces false-positive and false-negative results, and improves antimicrobial stewardship efforts by ensuring that only clinically relevant pathogens are identified and reported. By integrating evidence-based practices into laboratory workflows, diagnostic stewardship minimizes diagnostic errors, reduces health care costs, and enhances patient safety by preventing misdiagnosis, inappropriate antibiotic use, and delays in treatment.</para>
        <para>Effective diagnostic stewardship spans all three phases of laboratory testing. In the preanalytical phase, it involves appropriate test selection, proper specimen collection, and transport guidelines to ensure sample integrity and clinical relevance. In the analytical phase, it focuses on maintaining quality control, standardized testing protocols, and timely verification of results to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. Finally, in the postanalytical phase, it ensures that clinically significant findings are clearly reported, avoiding unnecessary reporting of contaminants or colonizing organisms, and that results are communicated effectively to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy and infection control measures. By applying diagnostic stewardship across these phases, laboratories can enhance patient outcomes, reduce AMR, and support evidence-based medical practice.</para>

        <para>Once a specimen is received in the clinical laboratory, the first step in determining the cause of an infection is to examine it. Infected specimens, such as urine, joint fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid, often appear “cloudy” due to the presence of microorganisms and white blood cells, indicating an infectious process is occurring. Sometimes, the infectious organism can be directly observed in the clinical specimen or even on the patient. Certain types of worms, or parts of them, can be seen in the feces of patients suffering from ascariasis or tapeworm infections. A careful examination of an individual's scalp or pubic area may reveal lice, while inspecting the anal region might lead to the detection of pinworms. Additionally, ticks can serve as vectors for several infectious agents, including those that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, and ehrlichiosis. When ticks are found engorged on the skin, physicians may remove and submit them to the laboratory for identification. This is important because specific ticks, such as deer ticks, can carry particular infectious agents like <emphasis>Borrelia burgdorferi</emphasis>, which causes Lyme disease. Identifying the vector can help physicians make a more accurate diagnosis for the patient.</para>

            <emphasis>Microscopic</emphasis>
          </emphasis>
        </title>
        <para>Microscopic examination is essential for the laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases, as most infectious agents are visible only under a light microscope. Although microscopic methods do not match the overall sensitivity and specificity of culture or molecular diagnostic techniques, they offer several advantages. Microscopy is rapid, generally more affordable than molecular techniques, available 24/7 in many institutions, and can be highly accurate when performed by skilled laboratorians. In microscopy, organisms can be detected either unstained or with various stains. Microbes exhibit characteristic shapes that aid in their identification. For instance, many clinically important bacteria are classified as either bacilli (rod-shaped) (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg04">Fig. 2a</ulink>) or cocci (spherical) (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg04">Fig. 2b</ulink>). Bacilli can vary greatly in length and may sometimes resemble cocci, particularly in the case of coccobacilli. They can also differ in thickness and may have pointed or curved ends. The arrangement of cocci is vital for identification; they can cluster (staphylococci), appear in pairs (diplococci, as seen with <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>), or form chains (as seen in various streptococcal and enterococcal species). Fungi are categorized into two groups based on their morphology: yeasts (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg04">Fig. 3</ulink>), which are unicellular organisms, and molds, which are multicellular with complex ribbon-like structures called hyphae (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg04">Fig. 4</ulink>). Parasites can also vary in complexity; they may be unicellular, like protozoans (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg04">Fig. 5</ulink>), or more complex, like nematodes and cestodes (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg09">Fig. 6</ulink>). Parasites are primarily identified based on their morphology. It is important to note that due to their small size, viruses cannot be seen using light microscopy. Therefore, alternative methods are required to detect these viruses in clinical specimens. Finally, microscopy serves as a valuable analytical procedure for screening specimens to assess their quality. For instance, when examining respiratory specimens, the presence of certain cells can indicate whether the sample is suitable for further testing. For example, if a sputum sample contains a high number of epithelial cells, this may suggest poor quality, which could lead to the rejection of the specimen.</para>

            <emphasis>Wet Mounts</emphasis>
          </emphasis>
        </title>
        <para>The wet mount technique is very straightforward to perform. As the name suggests, the clinical specimen is typically mixed with a small volume of saline, covered with a glass coverslip, and examined microscopically. This method is commonly used to examine discharges from the female genital tract for the presence of yeasts or the parasite <emphasis>Trichomonas vaginalis</emphasis>. Wet mounts are also employed to diagnose oral thrush, which is caused by the yeast <emphasis>Candida albicans</emphasis>. Using a specialized microscopic technique called dark-field microscopy, scrapings from genital ulcers and certain skin lesions can be examined for the spirochete <emphasis>Treponema pallidum</emphasis>, the organism responsible for syphilis. Although this technique is not particularly sensitive, it is highly specific when performed by an experienced microscopist. It is usually carried out in STI clinics, where there is a large number of specimens, allowing the microscopist to maintain their skill in identifying this organism. The wet mount can be modified by replacing a drop of saline with a drop of a 10% KOH solution. This variation is used to detect fungi, primarily in respiratory specimens, skin scrapings, and tissues. The purpose of the KOH solution is to “clear” the background by “dissolving” tissue and bacteria, which makes it easier to visualize the fungi. Another modification of the wet mount involves mixing a drop of 5% Lugol's iodine solution with feces. This stains any protozoans or eggs of various worms that may be present in the stool, making them easier to see and identify.</para>

            <emphasis>Gram Stain</emphasis>
          </emphasis>
        </title>
        <para>The Gram stain is the most commonly used staining technique in microbiology laboratories. It differentiates bacteria into two groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet stain, while Gram-negative bacteria do not (see Fig. 2). These two groups can be further categorized based on morphological characteristics. The structure of the bacterial cell envelope is key to understanding an organism's Gram stain characteristics. Gram-positive bacteria have an inner phospholipid bilayer membrane surrounded by a thick cell wall made of peptidoglycan, a polymer that provides structural support. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria also possess an inner phospholipid bilayer membrane, but their cell wall contains a much thinner peptidoglycan layer. Additionally, Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane composed of a phospholipid bilayer, which includes proteins and lipid A from a complex molecule known as lipopolysaccharide.</para>
        <para>Lipopolysaccharide is often referred to as endotoxin because it can induce various toxic effects in humans. Some clinically significant bacteria cannot be observed using Gram staining due to their size or cell envelope structure. This includes species from the genera <emphasis>Mycobacterium, Mycoplasma, Rickettsia, Coxiella, Ehrlichia, Chlamydia,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Treponema</emphasis>. Yeasts typically appear as Gram-positive, while the hyphae of molds may inconsistently take up the stain, but they generally appear Gram-positive. Although Gram staining can be performed quickly, careful attention to detail is essential for accurate results. One important indicator of proper staining is to examine the background of the smear. If there are significant amounts of purple (indicating Gram-positive) in the epithelial cells, red or white blood cells, or proteinaceous material—which should normally stain Gram-negative—it suggests that the slide is under-decolorized, potentially skewing the Gram reaction results for the bacteria. This under-decolorization is often observed in “thick” smears. Detecting over-decolorization is more challenging and relies heavily on the observational skills of the individual examining the slide.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> species<emphasis>,</emphasis> unlike other bacteria, are surrounded by a thick coat of mycolic acid. This complex lipid layer makes their cell wall resistant to staining with the dyes used in the Gram staining procedure. Consequently, bacteria in this genus are typically not visible under a Gram stain, although they may occasionally appear with a beaded appearance. Certain stains, such as carbol fuchsin or auramine-rhodamine, can interact with mycolic acids and are not washed out by acid-alcohol or weak acid solutions. This characteristic is why they are referred to as “acid-fast” bacteria.</para>
        <para>Auramine and rhodamine are nonspecific fluorochromes, which are stains that fluoresce when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Bacteria that retain these dyes during the acid-fast staining process can be visualized using a fluorescent microscope (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg10">Fig. 7</ulink>). The auramine-rhodamine stain is preferred in clinical laboratories equipped with fluorescent microscopes because it allows for visualization at lower magnifications. By screening at lower magnifications, larger areas of the microscope slide can be examined more quickly, making this method more sensitive and easier to perform than traditional acid-fast stains using carbol fuchsin and light microscopy.</para>
        <para>Several other organisms are also acid-fast but are typically not alcohol-fast. As a result, they are stained using a modified acid-fast decolorizing step, in which a weak acid solution is used instead of an acid-alcohol one. This technique is often employed to differentiate between two genera of Gram-positive branching rods.<emphasis>Nocardia</emphasis> species are acid-fast when the modified acid-fast staining procedure is applied, while <emphasis>Actinomyces</emphasis> species are not. Additionally, the modified acid-fast stain has proven effective in detecting two gastrointestinal protozoan parasites: <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cyclospora</emphasis>. It should be noted that <emphasis>Cyclospora</emphasis> stains inconsistently; some organisms exhibit a beaded appearance, while others do not retain the stain at all.</para>

        <para>The development of monoclonal antibodies has enhanced both the sensitivity and specificity of staining techniques that use antibodies to detect microbes in clinical specimens. The most widely used staining technique that incorporates the use of antibodies is the direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) stain. In this technique, a highly specific antibody is coupled to a fluorochrome, typically fluorescein, which emits an “apple-green” fluorescence. The antibody binds specifically either to antigens on the surface of the microbes or to viral antigens expressed by virally infected cells, which can be visualized under the fluorescent microscope (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg11">Fig. 8</ulink>). This technique is rapid, usually requiring 1 to 2 hours. In the hands of a skilled operator, the test is highly specific, although it frequently has a sensitivity of only 60 to 70% compared with bacterial culture. Because of its rapidity, the test has been used to detect some relatively slow-growing or difficult-to-grow bacteria, such as <emphasis>Bordetella pertussis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Legionella pneumophila</emphasis>, though it has largely been replaced by molecular detection methods. For respiratory viruses and herpesviruses, the sensitivity of this technique approaches 90%. However, the development of molecular amplification techniques for the detection of viral agents has demonstrated that DFA sensitivities can be as low as 50%, but may range up to 80% for some viruses. As a result, many laboratories have replaced DFA with molecular amplification for viruses.</para>

        </title>
        <para>Not all staining techniques used to diagnose infectious diseases are performed exclusively in microbiology laboratories. Hematologists and anatomical pathologists also play significant roles in diagnosing certain infectious diseases. One of the most critical diagnostic methods is the peripheral blood smear, which is the preferred technique for detecting malaria, an important infectious disease caused by protozoans in the genus <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis>. Various developmental stages of these parasites can be identified within red blood cells. Other less commonly seen parasites in peripheral blood smears include <emphasis>Babesia,</emphasis> trypanosomes, and microfilariae species. Occasionally, bacterial and fungal pathogens may also be observed in peripheral smears. The most likely of these is <emphasis>Histoplasma capsulatum</emphasis>, which appears as small, intracellular yeasts within white blood cells. <emphasis>Ehrlichia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Anaplasma</emphasis> can create characteristic inclusions (morulae) found in peripheral mononuclear cells and granulocytic cells, respectively. The examination of tissue samples by anatomical pathologists is essential for detecting certain infectious agents. For instance, tissue cysts resulting from toxoplasmosis can be identified in brain biopsy specimens from patients with encephalitis. The diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease relies on revealing typical lesions in brain biopsies. The presence of hyphal elements in lung tissue serves as an important tool for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis and pulmonary mucormycosis. Additionally, the discovery of ribbon-like elements in a sinus biopsy is pathognomonic for rhinocerebral mucormycosis, a potentially fatal disease that is commonly seen in patients with diabetes.</para>

        </title>
        <para>Visual examination of a clinical specimen is just one method for directly detecting an infectious agent. Advances in antigen detection technologies continue to refine the accuracy and speed of rapid diagnostic testing. Highly specific monoclonal antibodies remain the foundation of these assays, enabling the identification of bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic antigens. The most widely used antigen detection tests include enzyme immunoassays, lateral flow assays, and latex agglutination tests, which offer turnaround times ranging from 5 minutes to 2 hours. Point-of-care lateral flow tests, such as those for group A streptococci, have improved sensitivity and specificity due to ongoing enhancements in antibody development and signal amplification technologies. In the United States, more than 50 different test formats are available for detecting group A streptococci. Antigen detection tests remain widely used for pathogens such as <emphasis>Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis> and <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> toxins A/B, but have largely been replaced by molecular methods for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rotavirus, influenza viruses, and gastrointestinal parasites (<emphasis>Giardia</emphasis>, <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis>). The adoption of molecular diagnostic methods has clearly shown the limitations of traditional rapid antigen tests. For example, traditional rapid influenza antigen tests have reported sensitivities as low as 10 to 20%, while traditional RSV antigen tests have shown sensitivities as low as 50 to 60%, particularly in adult populations.</para>
        <para>The COVID-19 pandemic led to a resurgence in the use of antigen testing for viral respiratory infections, particularly for at-home usage. The effectiveness of these tests varied during the pandemic, influenced by factors such as the changing prevalence of the disease, the pretest probability (whether patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic), and the specific characteristics of each product. Currently, there are several brands of at-home COVID-19 antigen tests available, including tests that can simultaneously detect antigens for both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. At-home testing is also available for other significant diseases, such as HIV. There is an FDA-approved antibody test that individuals can perform at home, enabling them to determine their HIV status in their own space when they feel comfortable doing so.</para>

In many cases, these methods can also quantify the nucleic acid, providing critical information for disease management.</para>
        <para>Bacteria of a particular species have chromosomal nucleic acid sequences significantly different from those of other bacterial species, while highly conserved regions exist within a given species.

          </emphasis>
        </title>
        <para>Certain fundamental strategies are employed to isolate bacterial and fungal pathogens. These strategies depend on the phenotypic characteristics of the organisms being targeted and the presence of competing microbiota in a patient's clinical specimen. Most human pathogens thrive at 37°C, which is the human body temperature. Therefore, bacterial and fungal cultures are typically performed, at least initially, at this temperature. However, some skin pathogens, such as dermatophytes and certain <emphasis>Mycobacterium</emphasis> species, grow better at a lower temperature of 30°C. Additionally, a few clinically significant microorganisms can grow at low temperatures (4°C), while others prefer higher temperatures (42°C). Such incubation temperatures can be useful when attempting to recover specific organisms from specimens with a resident microbiota, such as fecal samples, as few organisms other than the target can survive these temperature extremes.</para>
        <para>Another important characteristic of human bacterial and fungal pathogens is their response to oxygen availability. Microorganisms can be categorized into three main groups based on their oxygen requirements. Aerobes can only grow in the presence of oxygen; this includes many fungi and bacteria. Anaerobes, on the other hand, can only grow in the absence of oxygen, and most of the bacteria that constitute the resident microbiota of the gastrointestinal and female genital tracts are anaerobic. Some bacteria are more versatile, as they can grow in both the presence and absence of oxygen; these are known as facultative organisms. A subgroup of facultative organisms, called microaerophiles, thrives best in environments with reduced oxygen levels. Good examples of microaerophiles include <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> and <emphasis>Helicobacter</emphasis> species.</para>
        <para>In addition to temperature and oxygen, nutrients are a crucial third factor influencing microbial growth. Many bacteria have relatively simple nutritional requirements, needing an energy and carbon source—such as glucose—a nitrogen source (which may include ammonium salts or amino acids), and trace amounts of minerals, particularly iron. Conversely, some human pathogens have more complex growth requirements, needing specific vitamins or less clearly defined nutrients like animal serum. Such organisms with intricate nutritional needs are often referred to as fastidious. A frequently encountered fastidious bacterium in clinical settings is <emphasis>Haemophilus influenzae</emphasis>, which requires both hemin (an iron-containing compound, or X factor) and NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or V factor) for growth.</para>

          </emphasis>
        </title>
        <para>The choice of media used to isolate pathogens from clinical specimens depends on several factors. First, it is crucial to meet the nutritional requirements of the specific pathogen. For instance, fastidious organisms need a medium enriched with specific nutrients, such as animal blood, serum, or other growth factors. When a clinical specimen is collected from a site with resident microbiota, specific strategies must be employed to isolate the target pathogen from the surrounding microbial community. In these cases, a type of media known as selective medium is often utilized to recover the pathogens. Selective media promote the growth of a specific group of organisms by incorporating substances like dyes, antibiotics, or bile salts that inhibit the growth of some organisms while allowing others to thrive. For example, Mac Conkey agar is a selective medium that contains bile salts and the dye crystal violet, both of which inhibit the growth of Gram-positive organisms and some Gram-negative ones, while supporting the growth of various Gram-negative rods. Some selective media also have differential properties (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg13">Fig. 10</ulink>). Mac Conkey agar serves as both a selective and differential medium because it allows for the differentiation of Gram-negative bacilli based on their ability to ferment lactose. Organisms that can ferment lactose are classified as lactose-positive, while those that cannot are called lactose-negative. When selecting media for culturing clinical specimens from areas with resident microbiota, both enriched and selective media are typically employed. If Gram-negative bacilli are present within this microbiota, a selective-differential medium may also be used. Certain organisms may not grow on standard laboratory media due to insufficient enrichment or the presence of inhibitory substances. In such cases, it is essential to inform the laboratory so that special isolation media can be utilized. Two important respiratory tract pathogens,<emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis> and <emphasis>L. pneumophila</emphasis>, are examples of organisms that do not grow on standard media and require specific media for isolation or molecular detection methods.</para>

        <para>Once organisms are isolated, they may be identified, and in some cases, AST needs to be performed. Bacteria and fungi grow as colonies on agar plates, and the appearance of these colonies is often useful in determining the identity of the organism. Colonies can appear flat or raised, smooth or rough, may pit the agar, or may hemolyze red blood cells in blood-containing agar. Molds, for example, exhibit distinct “fuzzy” growth on agar. Colonies of organisms such as <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis> may be pigmented or may secrete a diffusible pigment, as seen with <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>. Skilled microbiologists can often identify microorganisms based solely on their colonial appearance. In specimens obtained from areas of the body inhabited by resident microbiota, it is crucial to distinguish pathogenic colonies from those representing normal microbiota. Much of this differentiation can be made based on colonial appearance. However, some potential pathogens, such as <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>, a common cause of bacterial pneumonia, cannot be easily differentiated from viridans group streptococci, which are part of the resident oropharyngeal microbiota.</para>
        <para>In patients suspected of having bacterial pneumonia, a sputum specimen may be collected. Sputum consists of secretions coughed up from the lower airways, which are expectorated through the oropharynx and submitted for culture. Because these secretions pass through the oropharynx, sputum specimens almost always contain viridans group streptococci. The appearance of colonies produced by these streptococci is very similar to that of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>. To determine whether these colonies are <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>, tests based on the organism's phenotypic characteristics are necessary; these tests are known as biochemical tests. One common biochemical test to distinguish between these organisms is the optochin (also known as the “P disk”) disk diffusion test, which examines the organism's susceptibility to the compound optochin. <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> is susceptible to optochin, while viridans group streptococci are not (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg14">Fig. 11</ulink>). This simple test allows for the identification of <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis>from a sputum sample. Bacteria are typically identified based on characteristics such as colonial morphology, Gram stain reaction, the primary isolation media on which the organism is growing, and various biochemical and serological tests of differing complexity. Accurate identification of bacteria and fungi is essential because certain organisms (e. g.,<emphasis>B. pertussis</emphasis>) are responsible for specific clinical syndromes, such as whooping cough. Other bacteria (e. g.,<emphasis>Staphylococcus epidermidis</emphasis>) may be contaminants in clinical specimens, such as wound cultures. Proper identification helps determine the role of a particular microbe in the patient's disease process.</para>
        <para>Biochemical methods performed at the bench are a rapid and cost-effective way to get early information about an organism and, in addition to the optochin disk test, also include the catalase test (i. e., differentiating staphylococci from streptococci) and the oxidase test (i. e., differentiating most <emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis> from nonfermenters like <emphasis>P. aeruginosa</emphasis>). Organism identification may also be performed using a larger array of biochemicals in a single system. API (analytical profile index) strips contain a series of small wells with dehydrated biochemical substrates. When a bacterial suspension is added, metabolic reactions produce color changes that generate a numerical profile, which is compared to a database for species identification. Automated systems streamline this process by using micro-well cards or panels preloaded with biochemical tests. These systems analyze bacterial metabolism, enzymatic activity, and resistance patterns using advanced algorithms, providing rapid and highly accurate identification of bacterial species and their AST profiles.</para>

        <para>In recent years, organism identification has been revolutionized by MALDI-TOF MS technology. This technique analyzes the unique protein composition of a microorganism by ionizing its cellular components with a laser and measuring their mass-to-charge ratio. The resulting protein spectrum is then compared to a reference database to determine the organism's identity within minutes. MALDI-TOF MS is widely used for identifying bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria, offering significant advantages over traditional biochemical methods due to its speed, cost-effectiveness, and ability to identify a broad range of pathogens with minimal sample preparation.</para>
        <para>AST is typically performed on bacteria when there is suspicion that the organism is contributing to the patient's illness and when the susceptibility profile to antimicrobial agents is not predictable. Here are three clinical scenarios to illustrate this concept:</para>
        <itemizedlist id="ch0002s0001l03" role="decimal" mark="none">

            <para>A patient presents with “strep throat” from which group A streptococci are recovered. In this case, AST is unnecessary because group A streptococci are uniformly susceptible to the first-line treatment, penicillin. AST may be needed if second-line therapies are used, such as azithromycin, since resistance is more common.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0002s0001x08">
            <para>A patient has a leg abscess from which <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> is isolated. In this scenario, AST is important because some strains of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> may be resistant to first-line treatments, including semisynthetic penicillins such as oxacillin and dicloxacillin, as well as the second-line drug, clindamycin. The patient may start empiric antimicrobial therapy while awaiting the organism's susceptibility results. If the organism is resistant to the initially selected therapy, an alternative antimicrobial agent to which the organism is susceptible should be administered.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0002s0001x09">
            <para>The third scenario is more complex. A patient arrives at the hospital with a high fever, and two sets of blood cultures are drawn in the emergency department. Two days later,<emphasis>S. epidermidis</emphasis> is recovered from one of these blood culture sets. <emphasis>S. epidermidis</emphasis> is the most common blood culture contaminant. Recovery of this organism may be inconsequential, unrelated to the clinical presentation, and targeted therapy unnecessary. In such cases, AST for this organism is unwarranted. However, in the right clinical context, <emphasis>S. epidermidis</emphasis>could be a pathogen (e. g., suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis). In such cases, similar to <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>, <emphasis>S. epidermidis</emphasis>can also exhibit resistance to various antimicrobial agents, making AST crucial for determining the appropriate treatment. How to balance providing appropriate additional testing for organisms that are “sometimes” pathogens is one of the challenges in clinical microbiology. The decision whether to perform AST often depends on local policies and procedures (e. g., no AST on <emphasis>S. epidermidis</emphasis> from a single blood culture bottle unless requested by the clinician), local epidemiology, and patient population.</para>

        <para>Classic AST methods include the disk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) test, where antibiotic-impregnated disks are placed on an agar plate inoculated with the test organism, and zones of inhibition are measured to determine susceptibility. Broth microdilution involves exposing the organism to serial dilutions of antibiotics in a liquid medium, providing precise minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Similarly, agar dilution tests bacterial growth on agar plates containing increasing antibiotic concentrations. Gradient diffusion (Etest) combines elements of both agar dilution and disk diffusion, using a plastic strip with a continuous antibiotic gradient to determine MIC based on the point where bacterial growth is inhibited (<ulink url="ch0002.xml#ch0002s0001fg15">Fig. 12</ulink>). These standardized methods remain the gold standard for AST but often require 18 to 24 hours for results, delaying critical treatment decisions.</para>

        <para>With the need for faster AST results, modern rapid methods have emerged, especially for bloodstream infections where time-sensitive decisions are crucial. Automated systems provide rapid MIC determinations using optical or fluorescence-based readings. For positive blood cultures, newer technologies, such as rapid broth microdilution methods, the use of volatile organic compounds, and microfluidic-based AST, allow for faster detection of resistance patterns. Direct AST from positive blood cultures using disk diffusion or gradient diffusion shortens turnaround times by bypassing subculturing steps. Additionally, molecular detection of resistance genes can identify specific resistance mechanisms within hours, though they do not directly measure phenotypic susceptibility. These rapid AST advancements improve early antimicrobial stewardship by enabling clinicians to initiate targeted therapy sooner, ultimately reducing mortality and antibiotic resistance development.</para>
        <para>AST breakpoints are the defined MIC or zone diameter values that categorize a bacterial isolate as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to a specific antimicrobial agent. These breakpoints are determined by organizations such as the FDA and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in the United States and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) in Europe. Breakpoints are established based on multiple factors, including pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), clinical efficacy data, and microbiological resistance patterns. Laboratory-based MIC distributions help determine the natural variation in susceptibility, while PK/PD models assess how antibiotic concentrations interact with bacterial populations. Clinical outcome data from infections treated with specific antibiotics provide real-world evidence to refine breakpoints. These standardized breakpoints are critical for ensuring accurate AST interpretations, guiding appropriate antibiotic selection, and preventing both undertreatment of resistant infections and overtreatment that may promote AMR.</para>
        <para>Updating breakpoints is essential as new resistance mechanisms emerge and new antimicrobials are introduced, but the process faces significant challenges in the United States. Unlike EUCAST, which regularly revises breakpoints and mandates their use, CLSI updates are voluntary and require individual laboratories, hospitals, and diagnostic device manufacturers to implement changes. Regulatory hurdles exist because FDA approves breakpoints during drug approval but does not automatically revise them when CLSI updates occur. As a result, laboratories using FDA-approved AST systems may be forced to follow outdated breakpoints unless manufacturers update their instruments and seek FDA approval for new breakpoints, a process that can take years. This lag can lead to misclassification of resistance, causing clinicians to unknowingly use ineffective therapies. The 2017 FDA breakpoint harmonization initiative aimed to address these delays by allowing automatic updates when CLSI or another recognized body revises breakpoints, but challenges remain in ensuring widespread adoption across health care settings.</para>

        <para>Both <emphasis>Chlamydia</emphasis>, a type of bacteria, and certain viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they cannot grow on artificial media like fungi and other bacteria. Instead, they can only multiply by infecting living animal cells, including human cells, which are typically maintained through continuous tissue culture.

For <emphasis>Chlamydia</emphasis>, tissue culture may still be attempted, particularly in cases where the detection of <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis> is crucial for legal proceedings, such as allegations of child sexual abuse. However, molecular detection has become the standard method for diagnosing <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis> infections. Tissue culture remains an important technique for analyzing viruses. Although molecular methods are now the dominant method used for diagnosing viral infections, cultured viruses may still be needed for whole genome sequencing, typing, or resistance profiling. Herpes simplex viruses can be isolated from skin and genital tract lesions, often within the first 24 hours of incubation.</para>

        </title>
        <para>Isolating a microorganism through culture, visualizing it microscopically, or detecting it via antigenic or molecular techniques is not always feasible. In such cases, an alternative approach is to assess whether the patient has mounted an immune response against a specific agent, indicating infection by that agent. This immune response is typically measured by detecting antibodies in the patient's serum, which is why the process is called serology. Serology has both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include:</para>

            <para>Tests have been developed to detect most known agents, such as <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis> and <emphasis>Rickettsia rickettsii</emphasis> (Rocky Mountain spotted fever), which can be challenging to identify through other methods.</para>

        </orderedlist>
        <para>Depending on the target antigen for the immune response, serologic tests can demonstrate both high sensitivity and high specificity. Compared to other techniques, these tests tend to be relatively inexpensive and easy to perform, in part because they have been automated. Consequently, they can efficiently screen large numbers of specimens for selected infectious agents. For instance, this method is used to screen blood products for transfusions, ensuring that recipients do not receive blood contaminated with hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV, or <emphasis>T. pallidum</emphasis>, the causative agent of syphilis.</para>
        <para>However, serologic tests also have several disadvantages and should be interpreted cautiously. For a test to be positive, the patient must have mounted an immune response. Serum collected from a patient who is acutely ill may be taken during the “window period” before the immune response has developed. Therefore, to achieve the most accurate results, both acute and convalescent specimens should be obtained. To confirm an infection, the convalescent specimen should show a significant increase (i. e., 4-fold or greater change) in antibody levels compared to the acute specimen. Because the convalescent specimen must be collected a minimum of 2 weeks after the acute specimen, serologic diagnosis is often retrospective. Additionally, obtaining a convalescent specimen can be logistically challenging, meaning that often only the acute specimen result is available.</para>
        <para>Patients may have elevated antibody levels due to prior infections with the organism, potentially leading to false-positive results. Antigenic cross-reactions between the test organism and other antigens can also cause false positives. Furthermore, some immunocompromised patients may not be able to mount an immune response, resulting in consistently negative serologic tests. Serologic tests can be used in combination, typically involving a screening test followed by a confirmatory test. This approach is frequently employed in diagnosing syphilis, HIV infection, and Lyme disease. The screening test should be highly sensitive to ensure all true-positive results are detected, even if it lacks high specificity, which may lead to some false-positive results. It should also be easy to perform, allowing for the testing of large numbers of specimens at a relatively low cost. The confirmatory test needs to be highly specific to accurately diagnose the patient who tests positive in the screening phase. These tests tend to be more expensive and technically complex. For conditions like Lyme disease, techniques such as Western blotting are used for confirmation, which considers a patient positive only if they have antibodies to multiple specific antigens.</para>
