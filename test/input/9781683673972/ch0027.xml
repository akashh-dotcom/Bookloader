      <sect1 id="ch0027s0004"><title>CASE 24</title><para>A 62-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain and vomiting. The day before presentation, she had acute onset of diffuse midline abdominal pain followed by copious emesis. She had approximately 20 episodes of emesis overnight. She took activated charcoal and loperamide, with no improvement in her symptoms. The patient also reported a fever, generalized weakness, abdominal bloating, and headache. Although the bloating and headache improved, she had three episodes of watery stools after arriving in the ED. The patient lived at home alone with two dogs and worked at a preschool.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The patient’s rapid onset of “stomach flu,” which includes nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever, suggests viral gastroenteritis <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Her headache and malaise are also consistent with viral gastroenteritis. The most common causes of viral gastroenteritis are rotavirus, caliciviruses (e. g., norovirus and sapovirus), astrovirus, and enteric adenoviruses (serotypes 40 and 41). Although this clinical presentation could indicate any of these viruses, the most common cause in adult patients is norovirus. Norovirus is a highly infectious nonenveloped RNA virus that has also been called “small round structured virus” based on its appearance visualized by electron microscopy.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Norovirus causes both sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis and is considered the primary cause of endemic diarrhea in children <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Worldwide, rotavirus is the most important cause of severe gastroenteritis in children, but in countries that have rotavirus vaccines, norovirus has become the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in children. Norovirus causes ~90% of nonbacterial and ~50% of all-cause epidemic gastroenteritis. In the United States, this translates to ~20 million cases of acute gastroenteritis annually, leading to &gt;100,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths, mostly in adults ≥65 years old <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para>Transmission of norovirus primarily occurs by the fecal-oral route, but contaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization during emesis are other sources of transmission. Norovirus can survive at a wide range of temperatures (0 to 60°C) and is relatively resistant to detergents and common disinfectants (ethanol-based and quaternary ammonium compounds), but it is effectively killed by bleach. It is estimated that the infectious dose is &lt;100 viral particles. An individual infected with norovirus sheds billions of viral particles; shedding begins prior to symptoms and can last for weeks after symptoms resolve. Interventions to prevent norovirus infection include washing hands with soap and water frequently, rinsing fruits and vegetables, cooking shellfish thoroughly, and staying home when symptomatic and for 2 days after symptoms resolve<link linkend="ch0027s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para>Other factors that contribute to the communicability of norovirus include strain diversity and lack of long-term immunity. There are six genogroups of norovirus (I to VI), with genogroups I, II, and IV causing human disease, while genogroups III, V, and VI cause disease in cattle, mice, and dogs, respectively. Within each genogroup, there are antigenically distinct genotypes. This antigenic diversity is attributed to the accumulation of point mutations during RNA replication (i. e., antigenic drift) as well as to recombination events between antigenically distinct noroviruses (i. e., antigenic shift)<link linkend="ch0027s0002bib05">(5)</link>. However, despite this diversity, norovirus GII.4 (genogroup II, genotype 4) has emerged as the primary strain responsible for outbreaks. Human challenge studies have suggested that immunity is short-lived, as reinfection occurred when volunteers were challenged with an identical strain 2 to 3 years later <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib06">(6)</link>. It should be noted that 13 to 40% of volunteers were never infected, which appears to be related to specific histo-blood group antigen receptors in the human gastrointestinal tract. The combination of viral antigenic diversity and lack of long-lasting immunity is a significant challenge to developing a norovirus vaccine.</para>
        <para>Norovirus outbreaks can occur year-round but are more predominant in the colder months in temperate climates, thus the term “winter vomiting disease.” The incubation period is 12 to 48 hours, and illness generally begins abruptly with vomiting followed by abdominal cramps, fever, and nonbloody diarrhea. Outbreaks have been described in hospitals, schools (particularly child care centers and preschools), long-term care facilities, military camps, restaurants, and cruise ships<link linkend="ch0027s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Although this patient could have been exposed to norovirus anywhere in the community, it is likely that she was exposed at the preschool where she worked. Norovirus is the etiologic agent in ~50% of foodborne outbreaks; fruits, vegetables (especially lettuce), and shellfish have been sources of outbreaks. Oysters are a common source of foodborne outbreaks because they are often consumed raw or undercooked. Because shellfish feed by filtration, oysters harvested from norovirus-contaminated water have high concentrations of norovirus. A major source of foodborne outbreaks in restaurants and catered events is symptomatic food handlers. It is unclear whether asymptomatic shedding of norovirus by food handlers leads to transmission. It is currently recommended that food handlers not work while symptomatic and for 72 hours following illness.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Generally, norovirus infection is self-limiting, and there are no norovirus-specific therapies available. Because viral gastroenteritis due to norovirus can last 1 to 3 days, dehydration is the main complication. Replenishing fluids and electrolytes lost from vomiting and diarrhea is critical to prevent hospitalization due to viral gastroenteritis. This patient’s increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and heart rate indicated that she was dehydrated. She was given ondansetron (Zofran) for her nausea and vomiting along with 4 liters of intravenous normal saline. In immunocompromised patients (see <link linkend="ch0027s0004x06">question 6</link>), nitazoxanide (an antiprotozoal drug with broad antiviral properties) has shown some efficacy <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib08">(8)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Antimicrobial therapy, which she received 3 weeks prior to her presentation, is a key risk factor for the development of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>-associated diarrhea. In addition, community-associated <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection (CDI) now occurs at a higher rate than health care-associated CDI <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Although the risk of CDI is highest in the 30 days following antimicrobial therapy, the risk associated with azithromycin is much lower than for clindamycin or later-generation cephalosporins <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib10">(10)</link>. See <ulink url="ch0028.xml#ch0028">case 25</ulink> for more discussion on <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory. Infectious agents that invade tissue or produce toxins cause inflammatory diarrhea, which is characterized by the presence of neutrophils in the stool. Fecal leukocytes can be visualized directly with a methylene blue stain if the stool is promptly transported to the laboratory, but this is often not possible. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in neutrophilic granules that is important for mucosal immunity <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Inflammatory processes in the bowel that result in the recruitment and turnover of mucosal neutrophils will result in lactoferrin being released into the intestinal lumen, which can be detected in the stool by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunochromatographic test. Studies have shown lactoferrin to be a more sensitive indicator of intestinal inflammation than direct observation of leukocytes because its detection is not dependent on intact cells. Lactoferrin is also found in breast milk; therefore, children who are breastfed should not be tested for fecal leukocytes by lactoferrin detection. The challenge with interpreting a positive lactoferrin result resides in its lack of specificity for a specific disease process. For example, patients with inflammatory infectious diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, and colon cancer all have lactoferrin-positive stools. However, in the appropriate clinical context, lactoferrin testing can be beneficial. This is particularly true for differentiating patients with active inflammatory bowel disease from those with noninflammatory irritable bowel syndrome. Fecal calprotectin is another test that is helpful in determining intestinal inflammation and has been shown to be more sensitive than lactoferrin, though the same specificity concerns apply <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Calprotectin comprises ~60% of the proteins found in the cytoplasm of neutrophils.</para>
        <para>Bacterial pathogens associated with inflammatory diarrhea include <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis>, <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis>, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>, enteroinvasive <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Yersinia enterocolitica</emphasis>. Parasitic causes of diarrhea rarely result in a positive lactoferrin test, except for <emphasis>Entamoeba histolytica</emphasis>. Interestingly, viral gastroenteritis is not usually inflammatory. Occasionally, rotavirus and norovirus can cause mild inflammation, but usually the stool is negative for leukocytes. The positive fecal lactoferrin in this patient is not consistent with most norovirus infections. However, host differences may contribute to the amount of inflammation seen with viral gastroenteritis. This patient also had a history of diverticulitis, which can cause a positive lactoferrin test, so the positive may not have been a direct result of her norovirus infection. It is worth noting that fecal leukocyte, lactoferrin, and calprotectin tests can be falsely negative in immunocompromised patients who are neutropenic.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Although norovirus infection is usually self-limiting, it can cause greater morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Because patients who are immunosuppressed cannot efficiently clear the virus, norovirus may cause chronic gastroenteritis. Protracted norovirus illness has been reported in individuals with congenital immunodeficiency, persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy posttransplant, patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, and people living with human immunodeficiency virus. Approximately 15 to 20% of hematopoietic stem cell and renal transplant recipients reportedly have chronic infection with norovirus often lasting for months to years. This can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, and altered mucosal barrier, which may complicate the outcome of the underlying disease. Gastroenteritis is a common complication in posttransplant recipients, with causes including therapy, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), and a wide variety of infections. When a diagnosis of GvHD is being considered, it is critical to obtain testing for norovirus and other infectious agents as immunosuppression is increased in the management of GvHD but potentially decreased in infections.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Rapid diagnostic tests for norovirus are not currently available for most physicians. However, several commercial tests are available in clinical laboratories. Laboratory tests rely on detecting either norovirus antigen or RNA. Enzyme immunoassays detecting norovirus antigens have 61% sensitivity and 97% specificity <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Due to the low sensitivity of norovirus antigen tests, they are not recommended for the diagnosis of sporadic norovirus cases, but they have been used in outbreak settings when multiple specimens are being tested, which increases sensitivity <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the preferred method for detecting norovirus in stool specimens. NAATs are very sensitive and can differentiate the most common norovirus genogroups (GI and GII). There is one FDA-cleared commercial molecular test for norovirus and several molecular multiplex tests that detect norovirus along with several other community-associated diarrheal agents <link linkend="ch0027s0002bib16">(16)</link>. There are several challenges to using molecular methods for norovirus detection. For example, feces and vomitus can be difficult to extract and may be inhibitory to molecular tests. Therefore, it is critical to have controls that measure extraction and NAAT efficiency so that false-negative results are not reported. Also, the exquisite analytical sensitivity of molecular methods can decrease the clinical specificity. This is readily apparent in immunocompromised patients, who may shed norovirus for extended periods of time. Although symptomatic patients have high fecal viral loads, asymptomatic persons and chronically infected immunocompromised patients typically have low viral loads. It can be difficult to determine if a low-level positive by a molecular test is indicative of the current disease process. Quantitative NAATs may prove to be valuable in distinguishing acute gastroenteritis from chronic shedding, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.</para>
