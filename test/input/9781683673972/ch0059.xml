        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  In an immunosuppressed transplant recipient presenting acutely with fever, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms, the differential is quite broad, but includes pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, intra-abdominal infection, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis. The presence of ground-glass opacities is most consistent with viral or <emphasis>Mycoplasma</emphasis> pneumonia, and in immunocompromised patients, <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis> pneumonia. Infectious etiologies associated with nodularity, particularly centrilobular or tree-in-bud appearance, include tuberculosis, infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria, and disseminated fungal disease. At presentation, viral pneumonia was highest on the differential, but of greatest concern was disseminated fungal infection in an immunosuppressed host, as these infections can be rapidly progressive, require immediate surgical and antifungal interventions, and carry high mortality.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  <emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis> is a dimorphic mold, meaning it transitions between a yeast form at 37°C and a mold form at 25 to 30°C. <emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis> var. <emphasis>capsulatum</emphasis> is endemic in the United States, while <emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis> var. <emphasis>duboisii</emphasis> is endemic in central Africa. The positive <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> antigen test results are highly suggestive of infection. The BDG result, also known as the Fungitell assay, is also consistent with this interpretation. The Fungitell assay detects 1,3-β-D-glucan, a major cell wall component of many fungi, with notable exceptions including the <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis>, <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The assay takes advantage of BDG activation of the coagulation cascade of the <emphasis>Limulus</emphasis> crab, or horseshoe crab. The <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> cell wall contains BDG, rendering a positive result.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>Appropriate use of the 1,3-β-D-glucan assay is controversial, derived from variable literature on the clinical utility and complexity in both targeting testing to high-yield patient populations and interpreting results. Performance has primarily been studied in patients with severely immunosuppressing conditions or critical illness (e. g., ICU). Even within these populations variable sensitivity and specificity are shown across studies<link linkend="ch0059s0002bib02">(2)</link>. A number of sources of false-positive results have been identified, impacting the positive predictive value <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib03">(3)</link>. In addition, 1,3-β-D-glucan is not ubiquitous in fungi, and is notably absent in organisms of high interest in these immunocompromised populations: <emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis>, <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Without a nuanced understanding of test limitations in the specific patient population of use, there is risk for inappropriate result interpretation leading to misguided management decisions. Active stewardship can successfully target use of the test to the patient population likely to benefit most from the test and avoid unintended challenges of widespread use <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib04">(4)</link>. This is also true for patient populations where data on clinical utility is less available, e. g., pediatric patients<link linkend="ch0059s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  In addition to <emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis>, <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> species and <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> species are endemic in the United States, in addition to many other parts of the globe. The geographic distribution of each is expanding, as indicated by a recent study suggesting wider distribution than historically depicted in the United States (<link linkend="ch0059s0002bib06">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib07">7</link>). <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> is found primarily in the eastern half of the United States, heavily endemic in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. Activities that include exposure to birds or bats, as the organism is often found in their droppings, are the most common risk factors for acquiring histoplasmosis. <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> species are endemic in the upper Midwest and mid-Atlantic areas of the United States, with areas of significant overlap of <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> endemicity. <emphasis>Blastomyces dermatitidis</emphasis> is the species most found in this region, with <emphasis>Blastomyces gilchristii</emphasis> also being found in Wisconsin and areas of Canada <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib08">(8)</link>. <emphasis>Blastomyces helicus</emphasis> is present in western parts of the United States and Canada. Recreational or construction activities that disturb the soil around lakes and rivers in this region are commonly associated with blastomycosis, as these fungi live in the damp environment surrounding bodies of water. <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis> species are classically associated with the American Southwest. <emphasis>Coccidioides immitis</emphasis> is primarily found in the San Joaquin Valley of California, while <emphasis>Coccidioides posadasii</emphasis> is found more broadly throughout this region of the country. Inhaling dirt and dust in these arid climates is the most common mode of transmission of <emphasis>Coccidioides</emphasis>. Other dimorphic molds include <emphasis>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</emphasis>, found in South America; <emphasis>Sporothrix schenckii</emphasis>, the cause of “rose gardeners’ disease” and found globally; <emphasis>Talaromyces marneffei</emphasis>, endemic in Southeast Asia; and <emphasis>Emergomyces</emphasis> species found in areas of Europe, Asia, and most abundantly in Africa.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Antigen testing is the most commonly used <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> diagnostic due to the simplicity of sample collection, primarily serum or urine, and relatively good performance <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Traditionally these assays have existed as enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), but more recently lateral flow assays (LFAs) have become available. In cases of proven histoplasmosis and in disseminated disease with immunocompromised patients, the LFAs have similar performance to the EIAs <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib10">(10)</link>. While convenient and having the potential to provide more rapid, in-house testing for histoplasmosis, none of the currently available LFAs are FDA approved, which limits their broad adoption. Antigen detection is most reliable with acute pulmonary, chronic pulmonary, or disseminated disease <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Performance is particularly good for disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients, such as those living with HIV disease <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Antigen testing shows reduced sensitivity in subacute pulmonary disease and in localized infections, such as mediastinitis. While overall specificity is good, there are important caveats. <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> antigen tests show significant cross-reactivity with <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> and vice versa due to antigenic similarities. In fact, some laboratories have evaluated the use of a single antigen test for both fungi, no longer trying to differentiate <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Cross-reactivity is also seen with high frequency to the other dimorphic molds. As hinted previously, the Fungitell assay can be helpful in differentiating between <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> and <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis>, as seen in this case. <emphasis>Blastomyces</emphasis> yeast cell walls do not contain BDG, while <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> does. The positive BDG assay provides another clue to histoplasmosis over blastomycosis in this case. </para>
        <para>Serology is also a mainstay in the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The utility of <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> antibody detection is largely the foil to antigen detection. Methods for antibody detection include EIA, complement fixation (CF), and immunodiffusion (ID) <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib09">(9)</link>. EIAs offer the benefit of high-throughput screening for antibodies to <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> with high sensitivity. However, as with many screening assays, specificity can suffer. For that reason, diagnostic approaches often include confirmation by CF and ID, or skipping the EIA method completely and proceeding directly to these methods. CF testing uses both mycelium-phase antigens (histoplasmin) and yeast-phase antigens to detect antibodies. In general, a single CF titer of ≥1:32 or a ≥4-fold increase in titer between acute- and convalescent-phase samples is considered indicative of active infection. The principle of ID is based on antibody interaction from patient sera with mycelium-phase antigens to form precipitin bands in an agar matrix. Two bands of identity, H- and M-bands, can form. The M-band appears earliest and can persist for years after infection. The H-band follows M-band production and resolves more rapidly. Presence of an H-band indicates a more recent or active infection. In a review of <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> antibody testing in patients with culture-confirmed histoplasmosis, both methods showed sensitivity of ~60% <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Antibodies to <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> are produced within the first couple of months of infection, meaning there is low sensitivity in acute infection. During subacute and chronic stages of disease, antibodies persist and sensitivity is high. If patients progress into disseminated disease, antibodies wane and reliability of detection decreases. This is particularly true in reactivation and dissemination of <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> in immunocompromised patients where their immune conditions can drastically impact antibody production, leading to extremely low sensitivity of serology. Because the phase of disease and host immune status may not be clear upon initial evaluation, antigen and antibody testing is often ordered in concert. In contrast to histoplasmosis, serology plays a limited role in the diagnosis of blastomycosis given poor sensitivity and specificity of the antibody tests (<link linkend="ch0059s0002bib15">15</link>, <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib16">16</link>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The culture is growing <emphasis>H. capsulatum</emphasis>. When incubated at 25 to 30°C, <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> grows in its mold form. Recovery routinely takes 2 to 3 weeks but can take as long as 8 weeks. The burden of organism in the sample can influence the time to positivity. In this case, the burden of organism was substantial, leading to rapid visualization of growth. Macroscopically, mold-form colonies of <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> are most commonly white, with a dense cottony texture (<link linkend="ch0059s0004fg01">Fig. 56.1</link>) <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib17">(17)</link>. Important microscopic features of these colonies include thin, septate hyphae with tuberculate (spiky) macroconidia of 7 to 15 μm in diameter with microconidia of 2 to 5 μm in diameter (<link linkend="ch0059s0004fg02">Fig. 56.2</link>). If thermal conversion is performed, yeastlike colonies form, which microscopically appear as oval, narrow-budding yeasts 2 to 5 μm in size, although this process is no longer routinely performed due to the time-consuming nature in the era of quicker matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry and molecular identification methods. <emphasis>Sepedonium</emphasis> is a mold that can mimic the appearance of <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis>. The absence of microconidia and an inability to grow at 37°C are features of <emphasis>Sepedonium</emphasis> that help differentiate it from <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>As culture can sometimes take weeks, there are molecular methods to detect <emphasis>Histoplasma</emphasis> directly from clinical samples. While they can provide more rapid information, the data available suggest decreased sensitivity when compared to culture <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib09">(9)</link>. On histopathology, yeast forms can be seen intracellularly in macrophages.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Treatment guidelines depend on disease manifestation <link linkend="ch0059s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Liposomal amphotericin B (3.0 mg/kg daily) for 1 to 2 weeks is recommended for initial therapy. Treatment is then switched to oral itraconazole (200 mg three times daily, followed by 200 mg two times daily for 12 months). In immunosuppressed patients, lifelong itraconazole (200 mg daily) can be considered for suppression.</para>
