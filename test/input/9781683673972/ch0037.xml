      <sect1 id="ch0037s0004"><title>CASE 34</title><para>The patient was a 45-year-old male who was in his usual state of good health when he awoke at 3 a. m. with pain in the lateral aspect of his left calf. He looked at his calf and thought the pain was due to an ingrown hair, so he went back to sleep. At 10 a. m., he expressed a small amount of pus from the ingrown hair. Over the next 8 hours, the patient developed an area of reddening on the lateral aspect of the calf of approximately 5 by 10 cm. At that time, a small amount of pus was again expressed from the area of the ingrown hair. The patient went to his clinician, who attempted to aspirate the lesion and was unsuccessful. He was given an injection of ceftriaxone intramuscularly and was told to return if his condition worsened.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  This patient had cellulitis, an inflammation of the dermis and subdermis of the skin where the skin appears red and is warm to the touch. Cellulitis is most commonly a bacterial infection <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The etiology of this infection is most frequently either group A streptococci or <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Patients with this type of infection often dismiss this infection in its early stages as an ingrown hair or a bug bite. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial with good activity against group A streptococci and methicillin-susceptible <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Since this patient was a healthy, middle-aged adult, his clinician thought it unlikely that he would have a strain of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> that was resistant to methicillin and thus resistant to ceftriaxone.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The Gram-positive cocci in clusters are characteristic of staphylococci. The most common cause of cellulitis and skin abscesses is <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The Gram stain result puts the physician in a bit of a quandary. The patient’s infection progressed on ceftriaxone. This suggests that the antimicrobial that he was receiving was ineffective. Alternatively, the drug may not have had long enough to act. Approximately two-thirds of <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> strains that cause community-acquired skin abscesses are resistant to methicillin <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Methicillin is an antistaphylococcal penicillin <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Methicillin resistance <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link> in <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> strains is due to alteration in penicillin-binding proteins <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link>. If the antimicrobial, in this case methicillin, cannot bind to its target site, penicillin-binding protein, it will not be active against the organism and thus resistant. Methicillin-resistant <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>(MRSA) is resistant not only to methicillin but to nearly all beta-lactam antimicrobials, including common cephalosporins (e. g., cephalexin), beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (e. g., amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), monobactams (e. g., aztreonam), and carbapenems (e. g., imipenem)<link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Two newer cephalosporins, ceftaroline and ceftobiprole, are active against MRSA <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib03">(3)</link>. These drugs are infrequently used to treat these infections since non-beta lactam antimicrobials such as vancomycin, clindamycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are available that are effective against MRSA <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  A major conundrum that the physician faced is that a properly drained abscess caused by <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> will resolve on its own without further antimicrobial therapy in 85% of patients <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib04">(4)</link>. The concern the physician had is that the patient clearly had an infection, a staphylococcal abscess, and had gotten worse despite antimicrobials. He judged that the patient needed a different antimicrobial.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Since the patient got worse on ceftriaxone therapy, the physician believed the patient was infected with MRSA. Given that community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is frequently susceptible to three different oral agents—clindamycin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole—the physician had reasonable choices. Clindamycin was chosen because the physician had good success treating similar infections with that antimicrobial in the past and, having looked at the institution’s antibiogram, knew that clindamycin was active against 75% of the <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> strains.</para>
        <para>However, it is important to note that some strains of<emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> can exhibit inducible clindamycin resistance <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib05">(5)</link>. In these strains, resistance is mediated by the <emphasis>erm</emphasis>gene, which may be expressed after exposure to various factors. This resistance can be difficult to detect during routine laboratory testing, because the isolate will initially test susceptible to clindamycin. For organisms that may be capable of inducible clindamycin resistance (e. g.,<emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>, <emphasis>Streptococcus agalactiae</emphasis>, <emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis>), the laboratory should perform additional testing to confirm clindamycin susceptibility. A method commonly used in the microbiology laboratory is to perform a D-test when an isolate’s susceptibility pattern is clindamycin susceptible, erythromycin resistant. The process for the D-test involves streaking a lawn of the organism (e. g.,<emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>) on a plate and placing clindamycin and erythromycin disks adjacently with a small amount of space between them. If the organism is inducibly resistant, then the zone of inhibition around the clindamycin disk will be blunted in the area next to the erythromycin disk, resulting in “D shape” growth. This pattern suggests that the use of clindamycin may result in clinical failure, and in the setting of a positive D-test (or other inducible clindamycin resistance test), the interpretation for clindamycin should be changed to resistant, regardless of the MIC.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The major species of coagulase-positive staphylococci that causes human infections is <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>S. aureus </emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis><link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The beta-hemolytic colonies seen in <link linkend="ch0037s0004fg03">Fig. 34.3</link> are consistent with that organism. In particular, it is the leading cause of skin abscesses and may also cause necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, it is a common cause of a wide variety of serious human infection, including bacteremia; endocarditis; necrotizing pneumonia (often secondary to influenza infections); septic arthritis; osteomyelitis; staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome; and infections associated with foreign bodies such as prosthetic joint infections, pacemakers, and left ventricular assist device (LVAD)-related infections, plus dialysis shunt infections <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib06">(2, 6</link>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  You would want to know to which antimicrobials the patient’s <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> isolate is susceptible. But what if the susceptibility results are not yet available and the patient is failing current therapy as seen in this case? It is important that clinicians be familiar with their institution’s antibiogram. Antibiograms are recent cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility data for commonly encountered pathogens at the clinician’s institution. The value in management of this patient was when the physician decided to switch therapy, they would have data to determine what antimicrobial agent would most likely be active against the patient’s isolate. In this case, the physician could consult the antibiogram to determine in the local area which of the three oral agents widely used to treat CA-MRSA, clindamycin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, was most likely to be active. If all antimicrobials had similar activity <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> to MRSA, then other factors such as expense, tolerability, drug-drug interactions, or likelihood of compliance or allergic reaction could be considered.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Staphylococcus lugdunensis</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> is a coagulase-negative staphylococcal species that is associated with skin and soft tissue infections, including skin abscesses <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Like <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>, it too can be beta-hemolytic. An important fact about this organism is that it has been shown to cause native valve endocarditis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy, used in most large hospitals and academic centers, is considered the gold standard of staphylococcal species identification <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Smaller laboratories without this expensive instrumentation may do a coagulase test to identify staphylococci because it is fast, easy to perform, inexpensive, and accurate; a coagulase-positive result indicates <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> and coagulase-negative staphylococci are called just that. There are more than 50 species of coagulase-negative staphylococci.

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  In the early 2000s, a novel strain of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> emerged that was called CA-MRSA. When this organism emerged, there was a 3-fold increase in patients presenting to emergency departments with skin and soft tissue infections <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Importantly, in a small subset of patients, sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and pneumonia occurred, with significant mortality. The organism was particularly common in people who engaged in contact sports such as football, wrestling, and soccer <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib10">(10)</link>. The particular genotype, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, was USA300. It has a specific antibiogram that is the same as the one reported for the isolate in this case <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Although it is susceptible to three safe, oral agents (i. e., clindamycin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice because it is bactericidal and likely better tolerated than the other two bacteriostatic drugs. In addition, because the patient’s skin and nares were likely colonized with MRSA, decolonization might be considered<link linkend="ch0037s0002bib11">(11)</link>. This is accomplished by using the topical antistaphyloccocal antimicrobial, mupirocin, to decolonize the nares and chlorhexidine or mild bleach baths to decolonize the skin.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  When first described as an important cause of skin and soft tissue infections, the USA300 MRSA strain was found to have the gene for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), a pore-forming cytolysin <link linkend="ch0037s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Because it can kill leukocytes and other cell types, its presence was believed to be the reason for the enhanced virulence of this particular genotype. However, as this genotype was more carefully studied, animal experiments did not support a major role for PVL. Other tissue-destructive proteins such as alpha-toxin and phenol-soluble modulins appeared to be more important in causing tissue damage based on animal studies (, 14).</para>

In addition, it is a common cause of a wide variety of serious human infections including bacteremia; endocarditis; necrotizing pneumonia (often secondary to influenza infections); septic arthritis; osteomyelitis; staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome; and infections associated with foreign bodies such as prosthetic joint infections, pacemakers, and LVAD-related infections, plus dialysis shunt infections.</para>

            <para>A novel strain of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> emerged in the early 2000s called CA-MRSA. It is the most common pathogen in emergency room visits for skin and soft tissue infections. The organism has a unique antibiogram in which the organisms are resistant to methicillin due to altered penicillin-binding proteins. <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> with altered penicillin-binding proteins is resistant not only to methicillin but to nearly all beta-lactam antimicrobials, including penicillins, beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. The exceptions to this rule are two novel antistaphylococcal cephalosporins: ceftaroline and ceftobiprole. CA-MRSA is typically susceptible to three oral agents: clindamycin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.</para>

            <para>USA300 is a single clone of MRSA that is largely responsible for the explosion of CA-MRSA cases in the early 2000s. It has become the predominant MRSA genotype in the industrialized world. Not only is it responsible for two-thirds of <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> skin and soft tissue infections, but it also has caused bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and pneumonia, all of which are associated with high morbidity and mortality.</para>
