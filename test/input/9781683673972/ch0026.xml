      <sect1 id="ch0026s0004"><title>CASE 23</title><para>The patient was a female in her mid-30s presenting to the emergency department (ED) with several days of cough, diarrhea, fever, and myalgias. She had a history of recent injection drug use (fentanyl and methamphetamine) and was currently unstably housed. On initial presentation she was febrile to 102.2°F (39°C) and had a blood pressure of 129/83 mm Hg, heart rate of 112 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/minute, and SpO<subscript>2</subscript> of 98% on room air. Her review of systems was notable for fatigue, fever, congestion, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, myalgias, light-headedness, and headaches. Her routine labs were largely unremarkable but were notable for sodium of 133 mmol/liter and hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dl.</para>

      <para>Over the next 24 hours, the patient developed worsening hypoxia, needing 2 to 3 liters/minute of oxygen by nasal cannula, and the patient was admitted. A chest radiograph showed prominent interstitial markings in the lungs, which may represent pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia. A subsequent chest computed tomography scan was consistent with bronchitis, but not pulmonary emboli. A nasopharyngeal swab returned positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the patient was started on remdesivir. The patient's diarrhea worsened, now containing blood and mucus, consistent with dysentery. While one symptom of COVID-19 is diarrhea, it is commonly watery and nonbloody, making it unlikely for the virus to be the cause.</para>

A spot indole test was performed, which was positive. The isolate was identified as <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis> by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). However, secondary identification using an automated biochemical platform identified the organism as <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species. </para>

      <para>The antimicrobial susceptibility testing for this patient's isolate showed resistance to ampicillin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone. It was intermediate to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, but susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and meropenem. The patient was switched from cefepime to meropenem and symptoms resolved.

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  This patient meets two of four criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with a temperature of &gt;38°C and a heart rate of &gt;90 beats/minute. The differential includes <ulink url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9659511/">COVID-19</ulink> or other respiratory viruses, bacteremia, sepsis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and opiate withdrawal <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Appropriate diagnostic testing includes nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), a chest radiograph, blood cultures, and a molecular gastrointestinal pathogen panel (GPP).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The major causes of dysentery in the industrialized world include <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>, <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis>, and Shiga toxin-producing <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> (STEC). Testing for GI pathogens is most commonly performed by molecular GPP, almost completely replacing the use of stool culture. Many commercial GPPs exist with a wide range of pathogen targets included on the panels. Most include major community-acquired bacterial pathogens such as <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>, <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis>, <emphasis>Yersinia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Vibrio</emphasis>. Some include a variety of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, which can be of questionable clinical significance, while others avoid this controversy by choosing to interrogate only for genes encoding the Shiga toxin (<emphasis>stx 1</emphasis> and <emphasis>stx 2</emphasis>). Viral targets may include norovirus, rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, astrovirus, and sapovirus. Some panels also include evaluation for parasites, including <emphasis>Cryptosporidium</emphasis>, <emphasis>Cyclospora</emphasis>, <emphasis>Entamoeba histolytica</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Giardia</emphasis>. A challenge in the transition to culture-independent testing for GI organisms is the lack of isolated bacteria for susceptibility testing and for epidemiological investigations (e. g., foodborne outbreak investigation by the public health department)<link linkend="ch0026s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Refer to <ulink url="ch0031.xml#ch0031">case 28</ulink> for further discussion on this topic. To address this, some laboratories perform culture to isolate the pathogen when bacterial targets are detected on the GPP, allowing for additional testing or forwarding of the isolate to public health laboratories.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The clinical presentation is consistent with <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, which causes invasive diarrheal disease characterized by abdominal pain, pain on defecation, and the presence of blood and mucus in stool. The key feature of this organism is a 31-kb pathogenicity island-like region on a large virulence plasmid <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib03">(3)</link>. This pathogenicity island encodes a type 3 secretion system that plays a critical role in the invasion of the intestinal epithelium, which is central to the pathogenicity of this organism as it invades the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelium. <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, although nonmotile, can move from cell to cell via actin polymers. <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> is translocated across the colonic epithelium via M cells and subsequently ingested by macrophages. The organism produces molecules that induce apoptotic cell death of the macrophages, which leads to the escape of the organism and the release of a variety of cytokines that cause a massive inflammatory response <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Neutrophils destroy the integrity of the epithelial cell lining while at the same time killing the intracellular <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>. The severe tissue destruction results in impaired water, solute, and nutrient absorption and leads to the presence of blood and mucus in the stool, which is characteristic of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> infection.</para>
        <para>Treating diarrheal disease with antimicrobials is controversial. Some physicians treat dysentery using the belief system (and support from the literature) that it will shorten the course of illness and the period of infectiousness<link linkend="ch0026s0002bib05">(5)</link>. This is an important consideration when deciding whether to treat shigellosis since it is only spread from person to person either directly or indirectly via food, water, or fomites. Cefixime is a good choice for children because it is likely to be tolerated and there is little resistance reported. The reason for the controversy is that shigellosis is almost always a self-limited disease that will resolve within a few days in the absence of antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobials alter the intestinal microbiota, negating some of its benefits while putting patients at risk for other infections, including <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis>. Any antimicrobial pressure increases the likelihood of selecting for drug-resistant organisms. Multidrug-resistant <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> is relatively common in the United States; upwards of 5% of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> isolates are extensively drug resistant (XDR), meaning they show resistance to five drug classes <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib06">(6)</link>. It is important to note that international travelers are more likely to have multidrug-resistant <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>. As final consideration, guidelines recommend against antibiotic treatment of bloody diarrhea in most cases, due to the risk of STEC and subsequent hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Five to 10% of patients with bloody diarrhea due to STEC develop HUS. One of the important predisposing factors for STEC-induced HUS is the prior use of antimicrobials, especially trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, STEC was not detected on this patient's GPP.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>Mac Conkey agar is both a differential and a selective medium<link linkend="ch0026s0002bib07">(7)</link>. It is selective in that the medium contains compounds that promote the growth of nonfastidious Gram-negative bacilli while inhibiting the growth of other bacteria (e. g., Gram-positive organisms). Mac Conkey agar gets its differential property from lactose in the media, along with a pH indicator. If an organism can ferment lactose, it will produce acid and lower the pH of the media, resulting in a color change (pink). This allows for immediate differentiation of lactose fermenters (e. g.,<emphasis>Enterobacterales</emphasis>) and nonfermenters (e. g.,<emphasis>Pseudomonas</emphasis>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> and <emphasis>Escherichia</emphasis> are highly related genera, which cannot be reliably differentiated by routine MALDI-TOF MS databases <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib08">(8)</link>. While in general they can be parsed by some quick biochemical properties, lactose fermentation (<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, negative; <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, positive) and indole production (<emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, negative; <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis>, positive), there are exceptions (e. g., biochemically inactive <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> or indole-positive <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species) <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Therefore, when MALDI-TOF MS produces an identification of <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> from a non-lactose-fermenting organism, secondary identification may be necessary. In this case, an automated phenotypic testing method was performed, which utilizes a battery of biochemical tests to determine an identification. However, these methods are also not without challenges, as the biochemical inertness of <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> and “inactive” <emphasis>E. coli</emphasis> limits the accuracy of the phenotypic identification.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>   Patients with <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> dysentery are rarely bacteremic, and therefore recovery in blood culture is very uncommon. However, there have been reports of increased rates of severe shigellosis, including bacteremia, particularly in those infected with <emphasis>S. flexneri</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed, as susceptibility for most first-line drugs in the United States is unpredictable. CLSI recommends testing ampicillin, a fluoroquinolone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis> species isolated from stool. Resistance to these antimicrobials is reported as 40%, 15%, and 64%, respectively <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Azithromycin can also be tested, with resistance rates upwards of 25% being reported <link linkend="ch0026s0002bib06">(6)</link>. For extraintestinal <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, additional antimicrobials should be reported, namely a third-generation cephalosporin and, if resistant, a carbapenem. Notably, aminoglycosides and first- or second-generation cephalosporins should not be tested and reported on <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>. While <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> testing may indicate susceptibility to these drug classes, they are thought to be clinically ineffective.</para>
