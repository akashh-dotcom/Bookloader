The woman, who recently had unprotected sexual intercourse, was asymptomatic. Physical examination was normal. Pelvic examination demonstrated a white vaginal discharge but was otherwise unremarkable. A cervical swab was obtained and submitted for <emphasis>Chlamydia trachomatis</emphasis> and <emphasis>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</emphasis> testing by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Examination of a wet mount of the vaginal discharge revealed the presence of a protozoan with characteristic jerky motility. <link linkend="ch0008s0004fg01">Figure 5.1</link> shows a Giemsa stain of the organism.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The wet preparation demonstrated the trophozoites of the protozoan <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis>. Examining freshly prepared wet mounts of vaginal fluid, prostatic secretions, or urine from infected patients will reveal the organism in 40 to 80% of infected individuals. <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> is an extracellular parasite that infects the epithelium of the genital tract and is spread through sexual contact. It is 7 to 23 μm in size, with a typical jerky motility. Microscopic examination for <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> is highly specific because its unique morphology makes it unlikely to be confused with any other organism that might typically be seen in genital tract secretions. However, this is not true for urine samples, which may be contaminated with the commensal gastrointestinal trichomonad <emphasis>Pentatrichomonas hominis</emphasis>. For this reason, microscopic examination of urine for <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> is not recommended due to the risk of a false positive result. Laboratories widely use wet-mount examination because it is inexpensive, rapid, easily performed, and requires relatively simple equipment (light microscope). However, because detection is based on motile live organisms, the test is best done in the clinic unless a rapid transit time to the laboratory is possible. Trichomonads die quickly, and test sensitivity decreases to 20% within 1 hour after collection <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>. To ensure greater odds of detecting the parasite, the CDC recommends that wet-mount slides be read within 10 minutes of collection <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Wet mounts can also be used to diagnose <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> vaginitis. In this form of vaginitis, yeast and pseudohyphae will be seen on wet mount. <emphasis>Candida</emphasis> vaginitis is frequently seen during or following antimicrobial therapy that alters the vaginal microbiota.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  There are various diagnostic testing options available for <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA), DNA hybridization, culture, and NAAT techniques have been developed to detect this organism in the hospital and point-of-care settings. In recent years, NAATs have replaced most other testing methods in clinical laboratories. Culture techniques are more sensitive than wet mount but are expensive and time-consuming, and their performance is impacted by antimicrobial use <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Due to these limitations and the need for more sensitive testing, NAAT techniques have become exceedingly useful. There are multiple moderate- to high-complexity NAATs FDA cleared for diagnosis of <emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis>infection. Acceptable specimen types include genital swabs (e. g., vaginal, endocervical, urethral) and urine, depending on the assay. Overall, the performance of these tests is excellent, with sensitivity ranging from 88 to 100% in women and 77 to 100% in men<link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para>Multiple assays have been cleared for use at the point of care and include nucleic acid hybridization, immunochromatographic capillary-flow EIA, isothermal helicase-dependent amplification, and NAAT<link linkend="ch0008s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Some, but not all, of these tests are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib03">(3)</link>. CLIA-waived tests include assays that were cleared by the FDA for use outside of the hospital laboratory because they are simple to use and are associated with a low risk of error.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> is typically transmitted via sexual contact. Since <emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis> infection is not a reportable disease, the number of cases that occur annually is unknown. However, it is estimated that <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the world, with 156 million new cases diagnosed in women each year <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>. In the United States, it is estimated that 3.1 million new infections occur. Most women and men who present with <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> infection are asymptomatic, but a malodorous vaginal discharge is often present in women with symptoms. Symptoms of itching or burning are frequently associated with this discharge. The infection can also involve the urethra, resulting in symptoms of dysuria. In men, most cases are asymptomatic, though some men have symptoms of urethral involvement, including a urethral discharge. Involvement of the prostate or seminal vesicles may occur as well. Confirming the diagnosis of <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> infection in men is difficult. Direct microscopic examination is insensitive and the EIA tests are not approved for use in specimens collected from males. The sensitivity of culture for men is low compared to that for infected women. Even NAATs may be falsely negative unless multiple specimens are tested, and only some of these tests are cleared for use in men.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Given that the diagnosis of <emphasis>Trichomonas</emphasis> was confirmed in this patient, it was appropriate to treat her. Historically, a single dose of metronidazole (Flagyl) was recommended by the CDC and World Health Organization as primary treatment, with 400 to 500 mg twice daily of oral metronidazole or 2 g oral tinidazole as alternative treatments, but treatment guidelines have been updated in recent years based on new evidence suggesting that a 7-day oral metronidazole regimen reduces the rate of repeat infection in women by half <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This 7-day regimen is the preferred treatment for all women, with 2 g tinidazole as an alternative. Given that there is a paucity of clinical trial data in men, the treatment recommendation remains a single 2-g dose of metronidazole for this population. Recently, a 5-nitroimidazole drug called secnidazole <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib04">(4)</link> was FDA cleared for treating infections caused by <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Even though this patient was asymptomatic, she was at a very high risk for a coinfection with <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> because that organism had been detected in her male sexual partner. This finding prompted her visit to the clinic. Her presumptive gonococcal infection was treated with an intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone. In addition, since gonococcal infections are often associated with infection by <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis>, she was given oral doxycycline. In cases like this, treatment for both pathogens is often appropriate due to the risk of infection and because patients that present to a sexual health clinic may not return or may be difficult to contact for follow-up testing or treatment. Her cervical swab NAAT was subsequently positive for both <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> and <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis>. It is important to remember that patients can be simultaneously infected with multiple sexually transmitted infectious agents and that both <emphasis>C. trachomatis</emphasis> and <emphasis>N. gonorrhoeae</emphasis> more frequently cause asymptomatic infections in women than in men.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Trichomoniasis is strongly associated with other sexually transmitted infections, and comprehensive evaluation and testing should be performed when a patient presents with signs and symptoms of <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> infection to ensure that appropriate treatment, contact tracing, and patient follow-up are performed.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> has been associated with preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and low-birthweight babies <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib05">(5)</link>. The use of metronidazole during pregnancy has been controversial because this drug has been shown to be mutagenic in bacteria and carcinogenic in laboratory animals. However, recent CDC guidelines state that several meta-analyses have demonstrated that metronidazole is safe in pregnant women across all stages of pregnancy. The use of tinidazole has not been studied in pregnant women, and it should not be used.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Determination of whether a patient has a repeat or persistent infection is key to determining next steps. Commonly, the cause of reinfection is failure to treat the existing sexual partner <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>. In cases where the cause of reinfection is likely an infected existing or new sexual partner, treatment of the partner should be prioritized. While most recurrent infections result from reinfection, <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> resistance is possible. However, it is important to note that susceptibility testing on <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> isolates in the United States demonstrates low rates of resistance <link linkend="ch0008s0002bib01">(1)</link>. CDC recommends that all people who test positive for <emphasis>T. vaginalis</emphasis> be retested 3 months after treatment.</para>
