      <sect1 id="ch0030s0004"><title>CASE 27</title><para>The patient was a 21-year-old civil engineering student in the United States with expertise in water sanitation who had traveled to Ethiopia to work on a water project at a school in Addis Ababa. He presented with a 2-week history of nausea and vomiting that had increased in severity and frequency over the previous 3 days. He had been unable to keep anything down for the past 3 days and had occasional loose stools with cramping. He did not have a thermometer but had felt “hot” over the previous 3 days. He had not taken his malaria prophylaxis, nor had he taken any ciprofloxacin that was given to him by his physician in case he developed diarrhea. He worked at a school in an urban slum where he ate food and drank water even though the school did not have running water. He had never been tested for HIV but denied having had any sexual activity in Ethiopia.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The most common reason an individual consults a physician after traveling to sub-Saharan Africa is a systemic febrile illness with or without diarrhea, as seen in this case <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib01">(1)</link>. As travel from North America and Europe to sub-Saharan Africa for business, educational, or social reasons becomes more frequent, understanding the potential agents with which such individuals are frequently infected is of greater importance. A patient returning from sub-Saharan Africa with a fever is assumed to have malaria until proven otherwise <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib02">(2)</link>. This is particularly true for individuals who did not take malaria prophylaxis, as was the case here. Individuals who have been in Ethiopia are most likely to be infected with <emphasis>Plasmodium falciparum</emphasis>, which causes the most severe form of malaria <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib02">(2)</link>. It is important to note that patients with malaria can have diarrhea, so its presence as part of the clinical presentation should not be used to exclude malaria from the differential diagnosis. In our experience, malaria-infected patients with the poorest outcomes do not take malaria prophylaxis, nor have malaria considered in the differential diagnosis at initial presentation with a febrile illness. Diarrheal diseases in travelers are common, especially among those who eat and drink in venues with questionable sanitation, increasing the likelihood of consuming fecally contaminated food or water. Many pathogens are possible, including <emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis>, <emphasis>Shigella</emphasis>, <emphasis>Salmonella</emphasis>, enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>, and several protozoan parasites <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Given the duration of the patient’s diarrhea, <emphasis>Giardia lamblia</emphasis> and <emphasis>Entamoeba histolytica</emphasis> increase in likelihood <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib04">(4)</link>. <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Vibrio cholerae</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> is endemic in Ethiopia, but it is highly unlikely because the disease typically resolves in less than a week <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>
        <para>Typhoid fever caused by <emphasis>Salmonella enterica</emphasis> serovar Typhi is a possibility given his diarrheal disease and likely exposure to contaminated food and water. Typhoid fever typically is a systemic illness, with diarrhea occurring in a minority of patients.</para>
        <para>Hepatitis A and E should also be considered because both can cause vomiting and diarrhea, symptoms may be prolonged, and they are acquired by ingesting fecally contaminated food or water (6, 7).</para>
        <para>Another common cause of systemic illness with fever in an individual from sub-Saharan Africa is tickborne rickettsial diseases with <emphasis>Rickettsia africae</emphasis>. <emphasis>R. africae</emphasis> typically causes a much milder disease than <emphasis>Rickettsia rickettsii</emphasis>, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib08">(8)</link>.</para>
        <para>Both dengue and <emphasis>Neisseria meningitidis</emphasis> should be mentioned in the context of febrile illness in travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals who travel to Ethiopia, as well as many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, are at risk for yellow fever and should be vaccinated against that virus, although this vaccination is not required for entry <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Dengue is endemic in Ethiopia but is infrequent in travelers there. By contrast, it is an important agent for the febrile traveler who has recently returned from the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.</para>
        <para>Finally, Ethiopia is located in the “meningitis belt” that traverses Central Africa<link linkend="ch0030s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Despite the increased rate of <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> among the native population in this region, cases of <emphasis>N. meningitidis</emphasis> infection are rarely reported in travelers. Since only half of individuals who travel to that region of the world consult a physician prior to travel, it is unlikely that special precautions such as meningococcal vaccination are widely practiced in this group.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Given his 3-day history of vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal discomfort coupled with a high heart rate, low-normal blood pressure, and reduced perfusion to his extremities (skin cool to the touch), he likely had significant dehydration. Starting intravenous fluids would be appropriate.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Given his history of not taking malaria prophylaxis, malaria is number one on his differential, especially since he has a low-grade fever. Because his mental status was good, the concern for cerebral malaria, the most severe manifestation of this infection, would be reduced. Malaria would still need to be ruled out.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  An occult blood (or guaiac) test detects the presence of red blood cells in stools <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib11">(11)</link>. The presence of red and white blood cells in stool specimens is seen in patients with dysentery (bloody diarrhea) or colitis (inflammation of the colon). Patients with colitis typically have an increased peripheral white blood count with a neutrophil predominance. Dysentery and colitis can have both infectious and noninfectious causes.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  A patient with a clinical presentation of colitis and with trophozoites in stool consistent with <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> has amebic enterocolitis. <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> is a common etiologic agent of colitis in travelers to sub-Saharan Africa. There are four different species of <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Entamoeba</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> that are morphologically similar: <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>, <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis>, <emphasis>E. moshkovskii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. bangladeshi</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib12">(12)</link>. However, the finding of phagocytized red blood cells in the amoeba (pointed to by white arrows in <link linkend="ch0030s0004fg01">Fig. 27.1</link>) indicates <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>. <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> readily ingests red blood cells, while <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis> only infrequently does and <emphasis>E. moshkovskii</emphasis> and <emphasis>E. bangladeshi</emphasis> rarely do. Other parasites that cause diarrheal disease in travelers returning from low-income countries include <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Cryptosporidium parvum, G. lamblia</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis>, and <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Cyclospora cayetanensis</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib04">(4)</link>. The clinical presentation of these parasitic infections is significantly different from that seen with <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>. These patients tend to have malabsorptive diarrhea, with watery, foul-smelling stools. Neither red nor white blood cells are seen in the stools of patients infected with these parasites.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> infects only humans. Since it is primarily a colonic pathogen, it is passed from human to human primarily via ingesting food or water contaminated by human feces. This contamination typically occurs in environments with poor sanitation. This disease is particularly prevalent among low-income populations in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, India, Asia, and the Pacific Islands <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Children under 5 are particularly at risk for developing this infection in these areas, with malnutrition being an important risk factor for infection, morbidity, and mortality <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib13">(13)</link>. It is estimated that annually 50 million cases occur globally, resulting in 40,000 to 100,000 deaths, primarily in children less than 5 years of age <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib13">(13)</link>.</para>
        <para>The life cycle of this protozoan (<link linkend="ch0030s0001fg02">Fig. 27.2</link>) is important in understanding its efficient spread. This parasite has two stages: the infective form, which is the cyst, and the pathogenic form, the trophozoite. The infection is initiated when a cyst in contaminated food or water is ingested. The cyst has a chitin-rich cell wall that allows it to survive passage through the low pH of the stomach <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib13">(13)</link>. It excysts in the small intestine and releases trophozoites, which initiate infection by binding to mucins in the colon. Subsequently in the parasite’s life cycle, trophozoites encyst in the lumen of the colon to form cysts, which are excreted in feces. Those cysts are able to survive in the environment and are resistant to disinfectants such as chlorides. In environments with poor sanitation and hygiene, ingestion of food and water contaminated by these cysts can begin the infection cycle again <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  In the industrialized world, an important mode of <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> transmission is oral-anal contact <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib13">(13)</link>. This mode of transmission is typically seen in men who have sex with men (MSM). This is the population that is most likely to be infected with HIV. In MSM who are infected with <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> and who do not know their HIV status, an HIV test is appropriate <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib15">(15)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Between 80 and 90% of <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> infections are asymptomatic <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib13">(13)</link>. The events that result in clinical disease are multifactorial. The interplay of the pathogen, especially expression of virulence genes, and the host’s microbiota and immune system all play likely roles in intestinal and extraintestinal disease.</para>
        <para>The initial steps in infection are reasonably well understood<link linkend="ch0030s0002bib13">(13)</link>. The host ingests <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> cysts. The cysts resist stomach acid, allowing them to survive passage through this organ. The cysts excyst in the small intestine, releasing trophozoites. The trophozoites have Gal/GalNAc lectins on their surface, which allows them to bind to the mucin layer overlaying the colonic epithelium, leading to amebic colitis, as was observed in this patient. In most infected individuals, the infection stops at the mucin layer due to the interplay of three factors <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib14">(14)</link>. One, the particular genotype of the parasite may not express the genes necessary for the breakdown of the mucin layer. Second, certain organisms may need to be present in the microbiota to supply nutrients or enhance inflammation during the infectious process. The infectious process may not progress or be as clinically severe if they are absent. Third, individuals with prior infection may produce secretory immunoglobin A against the Gal/GalNAc lectin or have other innate immune factors such as complement that protect against infection at the intestinal epithelium surface.</para>
        <para>The initial step in developing clinical infection is the parasite’s degradation of the mucus layer<link linkend="ch0030s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Parasite genotypes that can produce glycosidases and cysteine proteases that degrade the mucin layer allow the parasite to bind to the intestinal epithelium. There, the parasite uses a newly discovered pathogenic mechanism called “trogocytosis” <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib17">(17)</link>. Trogocytosis requires direct contact between the <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> trophozoite and the intestinal cell. Unlike phagocytosis, where entire cells are ingested, in trogocytosis the pathogens “nibble” on intestinal cells, which ultimately results in cell death by apoptosis <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib16">(16)</link>. During this process, the parasite incorporates human cell membrane proteins onto its surface using molecular mimicry to evade the host’s immune response. Paradoxically, <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> can also phagocytize host cells, but data suggest they only ingest dead cells. Trogocytosis is also an important pathogenic mechanism used by <emphasis>Naegleria fowleri</emphasis> to destroy neuronal tissue during meningoencephalitis.</para>
        <para>The trophozoites produce prostaglandins that mediate diarrhea by stimulating host cyclic AMP production, which leads to blockage of Na<superscript>+</superscript> uptake and Cl<superscript>–</superscript> and H<subscript>2</subscript>O secretion, resulting in diarrhea.</para>
        <para>The combination of contact-mediated intestinal cell killing, secretion of parasite-derived macrophage inhibitory factor promoting intestinal mucosal inflammation, coupled with the host inflammatory response stimulated by the release of interleukin-8 by infected intestinal epithelial cells, leads to bloody diarrhea and colitis characteristic of <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> disease.</para>
        <para>The damage caused by the parasite and host’s inflammatory response disrupts tight junctures between the intestinal epithelial cells and the extracellular cell matrix, allowing dissemination of the parasite into the bloodstream<link linkend="ch0030s0002bib16">(16)</link>. The parasite is trapped in the liver, where it can form an abscess. Animal studies of amebic liver abscess formation demonstrate that testosterone levels determine susceptibility to abscess formation, with testosterone-treated mice having larger abscesses, higher parasitic load, and poorer outcomes compared to control mice <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib18">(18)</link>. A similar pattern in seen in humans, where abscesses are 10 times more likely in men. The impact testosterone has on abscess formation may explain why men have such higher rates of <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> liver abscesses.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  In this patient, microscopic stool examination was used to diagnose <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>. In much of the world, especially low-income countries, this remains the diagnostic method of choice because of its low cost and the widespread availability of light microscopes <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib19">(19)</link>. The problem with this methodology is it does not reliably differentiate <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> from <emphasis>E. dispar</emphasis>, <emphasis>E. moshkovskii</emphasis>, and <emphasis>E. bangladeshi</emphasis>, although the presence of trophozoites with intracellular red cells in the patient’s stool makes the diagnosis of <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> likely. The sensitivity of stool microscopy is considered low <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib19">(19)</link>.</para>
        <para>Three <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> additional diagnostic methods available in the industrialized world are antigen detection, antibody detection, and molecular multiplex testing, also referred to as gastrointestinal panels (19, 20). Antigen testing can detect <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> in stools and aspirates from liver abscesses. There is great variability in the sensitivity of this test when stool specimens are tested <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib19">(19)</link>. This variability may be due in part to the reference method used as a comparator. These tests are more reliable with liver aspirates than stool specimens, although the number of specimens used to evaluate this specimen type is limited. This testing is not widely available <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib19">(19)</link>.</para>
        <para>Antibody testing is used to detect <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> as the cause of liver abscesses <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Again, sensitivity is variable, but it appears more sensitive than antigen testing.</para>
        <para>Gastrointestinal panels that rely on multiplex nucleic acid amplification are widely available in the industrialized world and are replacing bacterial culture, viral antigen tests, and parasitic microscopic examination to determine the etiology of infectious diarrhea disease<link linkend="ch0030s0002bib20">(20)</link>. The bacterial, viral, and protozoan parasitic agents detected depend on the specific panel used. The current literature suggests that molecular multiplex panels appear to be highly sensitive for detecting <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis> in stools <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib19">(19)</link>.</para>
        <para>In the United States, gastrointestinal panels are widely used detection methods for <emphasis>E. histolytica</emphasis>. In one study evaluating more than 9,000 patients, only two tested positive, suggesting that this pathogen is rarely encountered as a cause of diarrhea in the United States <link linkend="ch0030s0002bib20">(20)</link>.</para>
        <para>As far as testing for this pathogen in stools, microscopic examination and molecular detection are the most likely available methods.</para>
