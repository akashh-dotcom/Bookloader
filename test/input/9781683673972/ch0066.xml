The day prior to presentation, she developed bilateral conjunctivitis and a maculopapular rash on her chest and the ventral surface of her forearms. She had not taken her temperature, but noted she was having chills. She had returned from the Dominican Republic 8 days prior, where she was visiting family. During her visit, she spent a lot of time outdoors and received multiple mosquito bites. Her uncle in the Dominican Republic was also recently sick and had a rash similar to hers.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Depending on the area(s) to be visited, travelers to the Dominican Republic should be aware of possible exposures and consider vaccines to prevent hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, rabies, typhoid fever, and yellow fever and prophylactic medicine to prevent malaria <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Other diseases found in the Dominican Republic that are not vaccine preventable include leptospirosis, dengue, leishmaniasis, Zika, hantavirus, and tuberculosis. Travelers’ diarrhea is the most commonly acquired infection, which is primarily due to one of several bacterial agents and has been associated with street food and informal food sellers at the beach <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Of the vector-borne diseases, dengue is the most common, with infections occurring year-round, but the rainy season (May to November) typically has more cases. There were ~28,000 cases of dengue in the Dominican Republic in 2023. Over the past several years there have been a few notable outbreaks in the Dominican Republic. In 2014, there was a chikungunya outbreak in the Caribbean that caused nearly 4,000 infections in travelers; the Dominican Republic had the highest number of cases reported <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib03">(3, 4</link>). In 2015–2016, epidemics of Zika virus occurred in the Americas, which led to ~5,000 travel-associated infections in the United States and ~5,000 local cases in the Dominican Republic <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib06">(5, 6</link>). In 2016–2017, there was a cholera outbreak on the island of Hispaniola, though ~99% of cases were in Haiti. Cholera was introduced to Haiti in 2010 by relocated United Nations troops; then the outbreak was exacerbated by a hurricane and associated flooding in 2016 <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib07">(7)</link>. The Dominican Republic had &gt;1,000 cases of cholera in 2016–2017. In 2023, there were ~150 cases of cholera in the Dominican Republic, which were spillover cases from a larger cholera outbreak in Haiti.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Based on her clinical presentation (nausea, vomiting, headache, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia), travel history, and mosquito exposure, the vector-borne diseases caused by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses are most likely. Bilateral conjunctivitis is strongly associated with Zika, though it can also be seen with chikungunya and more rarely dengue. If she had presented with intense joint pain, dengue or chikungunya would be more likely than Zika. In 2016, there was ongoing transmission of both Zika and dengue viruses in the Dominican Republic <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib08">(8)</link>. However, since the 2016 outbreak of Zika virus, there have not been new cases in the Dominican Republic. Likewise, since the 2014 chikungunya virus outbreak, there have not been any reported cases. If this case occurred in 2023, then diagnostic testing should focus on dengue virus since there have not been cases of chikungunya or Zika viruses reported in several years.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  During the 2016 Zika outbreak in the Americas, the recommendations for Zika virus diagnostic testing were based on how long after symptom onset the specimen was collected. Patients with &lt;4 days of symptoms should only have NAATs performed. Zika virus RNA can be detected in serum in the first week of illness and in urine in the first 2 weeks of illness. Virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and neutralizing antibodies typically develop toward the end of the first week of illness. If the patient is 4 to 7 days postsymptom onset, then a NAAT and IgM test should be performed on serum and a NAAT on urine. For patients 7 to 14 days after onset of symptoms, IgM detection from serum and a NAAT on urine should be done. Only serologic testing is indicated for patients &gt;14 days from symptom onset. Since this patient began having symptoms 4 days prior, serum and urine NAATs for Zika virus RNA and serum IgM should be sent to a public health laboratory for testing. Since the epidemiology of Zika and dengue viruses overlapped at the time this patient traveled to the Dominican Republic, testing is needed for both viruses <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib09">(9)</link>. Dengue virus diagnostic tests include a NAAT and IgM test on serum. Since the Zika outbreak is no longer ongoing, current recommendations are only to test pregnant women for Zika virus <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Given the current epidemiology, nonpregnant symptomatic patients should follow recommendations for dengue virus testing.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  Based on the patient’s positive NAAT from urine for Zika RNA, the patient had acute Zika virus infection (<link linkend="ch0066s0001fg01">Fig. 63.1</link>). The patient’s serum was not tested for Zika RNA, but it likely would have also been positive. Unlike serologic tests for flaviviruses, NAATs are very specific to the flavivirus being tested. Unsurprisingly, the patient had not developed IgM to Zika virus yet; this usually appears ~7 days after symptom onset. For serologic testing it is important to note that cross-reaction among flaviviruses (i. e., Zika, dengue, and yellow fever) is common and complicates the interpretation of positive results when individuals have a history of flavivirus infection or vaccination or traveled to locations with cocirculation of flaviviruses (see<ulink url="ch0050.xml#ch0050">case 47</ulink>). Plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) can be performed to measure virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and discriminate between cross-reacting antibodies in primary flavivirus infections <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib11">(11)</link>.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Zika virus is a member of the <emphasis>Flavivirus</emphasis> genus, which also includes dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. It is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) that is transmitted by <emphasis>Aedes</emphasis> spp. mosquitoes, which are widespread globally <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib12">(12)</link>. It was discovered in 1947 from a rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda though a yellow fever virus surveillance program. The first known human case was in 1954 in Nigeria. The first documented outbreak of Zika was in 2007 in Yap State, a Western Pacific island in Micronesia <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Larger epidemics occurred in 2013–2014 in French Polynesia, where smaller outbreaks continued to occur in subsequent years. Outbreaks of Zika were first described in the Americas with a Brazilian outbreak in 2015. In 2016, Zika virus spread throughout the Americas, including many epidemics in the Caribbean. There were ~725,000 Zika cases in the Americas in 2015–2016. Currently, there are no declared outbreaks of Zika, but sporadic cases continue to occur <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib12">(12)</link>. There were &gt;36,000 Zika cases in the Americas in 2023, with Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela having the most cases. The climate crisis and the continued expansion of <emphasis>Aedes</emphasis> species’ geographical distribution will undoubtedly lead to more Zika outbreaks.</para>
        <para>Most people who are infected with Zika virus are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. About 20% of those infected display symptoms, which include a pruritic maculopapular rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and conjunctivitis<link linkend="ch0066s0002bib13">(13)</link>. The incubation period is 3 to 14 days, and the natural disease course is ~1 week. In addition to the vector-borne spread of disease, Zika can be spread by maternal-fetal or sexual transmission and by blood transfusions, particularly during epidemics. Prevention of infections includes mosquito bite prevention, condom use, and screening the blood supply. The blood supply in the United States was screened for Zika RNA by NAAT from 2016 to 2021 when there were reports of local transmission in Florida, Texas, and U. S. territories<link linkend="ch0066s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The patient had a pregnancy test for two reasons: (i) she had symptoms of nausea and vomiting in the setting of trying to conceive, and (ii) Zika virus infection can be passed to the fetus. If the patient needed diagnostic radiology, a pregnancy test would also be warranted independent of symptoms.</para>
        <para>Zika virus infection during pregnancy may lead to brain, eye, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the fetus and even fetal demise<link linkend="ch0066s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Babies may be born with congenital Zika syndrome, which may include microcephaly (and associated reduced brain size and function), damage to the eye with potential vision loss, limited range of motion and body movements, seizures, difficulty swallowing, and hearing loss <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib16">(16)</link>. About 5 to 14% of babies born after a Zika virus infection during gestation will have sequalae at birth, but babies may not have apparent defects at birth and still be affected by long-term health problems, including postnatal microcephaly, vision problems, and increased mortality rate <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib17">(17, 18</link>). Both asymptomatic and symptomatic maternal infections may lead to congenital Zika syndrome and birth defects. Although infection at any time during gestation may lead to congenital Zika syndrome, infection during the first trimester carries the highest risk. If the patient had been pregnant, the fetus should be monitored for signs of congenital Zika virus infection <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib19">(19)</link>. After birth, the infant should be tested for congenital Zika infection independent of apparent birth defects so that the child can be monitored appropriately during development <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib20">(20)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Zika virus infection is primarily a concern for pregnant women and individuals trying to conceive (male or female). Although 50 to 80% of Zika virus infections are asymptomatic, the virus can still be passed on to sexual partners <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib21">(21)</link>. Zika virus has been found in the semen of infected, even if asymptomatic, men for up to 3 months <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib22">(22)</link>. Therefore, if a couple is actively trying to conceive and one or both have traveled to an area where Zika is endemic, it is recommended that they postpone conception plans and abstain from sex or use barrier protection for 2 to 3 months, depending on who traveled <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib21">(21)</link>. If a partner is pregnant, and the male traveled to an area of endemicity, barrier protection should be used for the entire pregnancy. This patient was diagnosed with acute Zika virus infection, and her partner may have also been asymptomatically infected. It is recommended that they postpone their conception plans for 3 months. Had the patient’s partner not traveled to the Dominican Republic, conception plans should be postponed for 2 months after her symptom onset.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  At the time of this case, Zika virus epidemics were still occurring in the Americas. In 2016, there were ~36,000 confirmed Zika cases in Puerto Rico <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib23">(23)</link>. Although the patient had Zika virus infection 4 months previously, there are not reliable serologic tests to assess immunity, particularly in the setting of pregnancy when the risk for complications is high. The patient’s obstetrician recommended that she not travel to Puerto Rico while pregnant because of the ongoing epidemic and high case rate. If the patient decided to travel despite this recommendation, she should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites and sexual exposure to Zika virus.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  Although several neurologic complications like encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, motor and cognitive impairment, and peripheral neuropathy have been described, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common neurologic sequela in adults after Zika virus infection <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib24">(24, 25</link>). There are ~2 cases of GBS per 10,000 Zika virus infections. GBS is a neurologic disorder that usually presents as progressive, ascending limb weakness up to 4 weeks after an infection or vaccination. The pathogen with the strongest association with GBS is <emphasis>Campylobacter jejuni</emphasis> (see <ulink url="ch0024.xml#ch0024">case 21</ulink>). Studies of post-<emphasis>Campylobacter</emphasis> GBS have suggested that molecular mimicry between microbial and nerve antigens plays a role in disease pathogenesis <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib26">(26)</link>. Other potential antecedent infections include cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis E virus, influenza A virus, <emphasis>Haemophilus influenzae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</emphasis>. Increases of GBS incidence during outbreaks have been observed with Zika virus, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib27">(27)</link>. As described for other GBS antecedent infections, post-Zika GBS is likely immune mediated, as patients have shown higher levels of anti-ganglioside antibodies <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib28">(28)</link>. Most patients with post-Zika GBS fully recover, but some patients have ongoing mild to moderate disability <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib29">(29)</link>. Plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are treatments that have been used successfully in patients with severe acute GBS to lessen immune-related nerve damage <link linkend="ch0066s0002bib30">(30)</link>.</para>
