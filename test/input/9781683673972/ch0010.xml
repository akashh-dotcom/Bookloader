        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>The Mc Isaac scoring system for diagnosing strep throat is based on five criteria: temperature &gt;38°C, no cough, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar swelling and exudates, and age 3 to 14<link linkend="ch0010s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Children less than 3 years old rarely are infected with GAS. This patient was positive for all five criteria. Patients with this score are estimated to have a risk of ~50% of having GAS pharyngitis. Although not part of the prediction rule, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are frequently seen in pediatric patients with GAS pharyngitis, though only abdominal pain was seen in this patient.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Viral agents are the primary pathogens causing pharyngitis <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib02">(2)</link>. These include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus. Patients with viral pharyngitis typically have cough and rhinorrhea and may have conjunctivitis. This constellation of symptoms typically is self-limited. Viral pharyngitis should be treated only symptomatically with analgesics and warm saltwater gargles. In patients with his presentation, group A streptococci testing is not recommended <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Studies have shown that these guidelines are often not followed in children and even less frequently in adults <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib04">(4</link>–<link linkend="ch0010s0002bib05">5)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>Approximately 70% of clinical diagnoses rely on the results of diagnostic tests, including laboratory tests and imaging studies. Direct antigen detection is commonly used to diagnose GAS infections. This is accomplished by extracting the group A polysaccharide antigen from the throat swab and performing an immunoassay on the extract. The test is very rapid, taking 10 to 15 minutes, and is highly specific (&gt;95%), but when compared with culture it has a sensitivity of 80 to 90%, meaning that this test will not detect GAS in 10 to 20% of patients with GAS in their throats. The advantage of the “rapid strep test,” as it is called, is that a swab can be obtained in the office or clinic and a result can be obtained while the patient waits (i. e., a “point of care” microbiology test). For patients with a high pretest probability of disease, such as this patient, and a positive rapid GAS antigen test, antibiotics can be prescribed on the spot if that is the clinical decision that is reached. Figure 1 shows a rapid GAS antigen test as was seen in this patient.</para>
        <para>A negative GAS antigen test may present the physician with a more complex decision. Because of concerns about post-streptococcal sequelae (see the<phrase>answer to question 5</phrase> for a further explanation), pediatricians may “back up” negative rapid GAS antigen tests with culture. There are at least four possible outcomes of a confirmatory bacterial culture. (i) It can be negative for all potential bacterial agents of pharyngitis. (ii) It can be positive for GAS with a clinical score supporting the GAS diagnosis. The physician will need to decide whether to treat or not. (iii) It can be positive for GAS but represent asymptomatic carriage. During the winter and early spring months, when GAS pharyngitis is most common, GAS carriage rates of between 10 and 20% may be present in children. Antimicrobial treatment in this group is controversial but may be done if recurrent GAS infections are being seen in other family members. (iv) It can be positive for other pharyngitis-associated bacterial agents, including groups C and G streptococci or <emphasis>Arcanobacterium haemolyticum</emphasis>. There is no evidence that these agents cause nonsuppurative post-streptococcal sequelae. Nor is there good evidence that antimicrobials will reduce the length of their disease course. Given the limited benefit, there is no evidence that culture should be used to support the treatment of pharyngitis with these organisms. Confirmatory testing is not recommended in adults because post-streptococcal sequelae are rare.</para>
        <para>A recent innovation that may change the landscape of GAS diagnostics is point-of-care molecular testing<link linkend="ch0010s0002bib06">(6)</link>. This testing is as sensitive as culture, if not even more so, and takes less than 30 minutes, compared to 18 to 24 hours for culture. There are two distinct disadvantages, cost and an inability to distinguish between the carrier state and true infection. However, if clinical scoring systems are used with this test, the problem of detecting the carrier state is diminished. Clinical outcome studies are needed to determine if molecular testing costs can be justified based on improved clinical outcomes, especially reduction in unnecessary antimicrobial use.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  A good definition of antimicrobial stewardship is using antimicrobial agents responsibly, which includes administering the most appropriate antimicrobial at the right time using the right dose <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Responsible use in individuals with pharyngitis is to treat only patients who are infected with GAS with antimicrobials and not treat others <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib03">(3)</link>. In those being treated, narrow-spectrum antimicrobials should be used, preferably amoxicillin, as was used in this patient. With more than 11 million outpatient visits annually, pharyngitis is one of the most common reasons children and adolescents visit a clinical provider <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib06">(6)</link>. It is estimated that 15% of all outpatient prescriptions in children 3 to 9 years of age are for pharyngitis <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Only 15 to 30% of those children and adolescents are positive for GAS, warranting the use of a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial such as amoxicillin <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Unfortunately, 25 to 40% may receive antimicrobials inappropriately, in part because physicians do not follow practice guidelines for management of GAS pharyngitis or acquiesce to parents demanding antimicrobial prescriptions because they believe the child will get “better” sooner, allowing parents to return more quickly to pre-illness activities (<link linkend="ch0010s0002bib03">3</link>, <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib06">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib09">9</link>). In adults with pharyngitis, 5 to 15% are positive for GAS, with an even higher percentage receiving antimicrobials inappropriately <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  There are several benefits of antibiotics in the treatment of GAS pharyngitis. Of greatest significance is that treatment prevents nonsuppurative post-streptococcal sequelae <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Antimicrobials have been shown to shorten the time the patient is symptomatic by 1 to 2 days. Additionally, antibiotic therapy will prevent suppurative complications of GAS, such as peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses, and decrease the infectivity of the infected individual. In school-age children, this is important so that they are less likely to infect their classmates and siblings, both at-risk populations. Because suppurative and non-suppurative post-streptococcal sequelae are now rare in the industrialized world, the importance of antimicrobial therapy in GAS treatment is limited to the benefits of shortening disease course and decreasing transmissibility. This benefit must be balanced with the risks of antimicrobial therapy. These include allergic reactions, especially since this infection is treated with penicillin; changes in the microbiota that may put the patient at risk for other infections; and increasing antimicrobial resistance among respiratory pathogens such as <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>The patient was at risk for two nonsuppurative post-streptococcal sequelae, rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. Because he received antimicrobial therapy, his risk of rheumatic fever was essentially zero. The likelihood of an untreated infected person developing either one of these complications is low in the industrialized world, but in certain populations, such as Maori and Pacific Islanders, rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis case rates are high<link linkend="ch0010s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Nonsuppurative post-streptococcal sequelae case rates are significantly higher in crowded, economically poor tropical regions <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Glomerulonephritis is seen following both pharyngitis and skin infections (pyoderma or impetigo), whereas rheumatic fever typically, but not exclusively, occurs following pharyngitis.</para>
        <para>These noninfectious post-streptococcal sequelae occur after an acute GAS infection. Rheumatic fever occurs 1 to 5 weeks after infection, while glomerulonephritis following pharyngitis occurs at 1 to 2 weeks and 3 to 6 weeks following pyoderma.</para>
        <para>In rheumatic fever, antibodies directed against the M protein and the group A carbohydrate GlcNAc are thought to cross-react with various tissue components in the heart, including myosin, actin, laminin, and tropomyosin<link linkend="ch0010s0002bib12">(12)</link>. This reaction can result in fibrosis of heart valves and muscles and produce the carditis and heart murmurs that are manifestations of this syndrome. Diagnosis of rheumatic fever is based on clinical and laboratory findings called the Jones criteria <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib13">(13)</link>. To fulfill the rheumatic fever diagnosis criteria, the patient must have two major or one major and two minor criteria.</para>

          <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  GAS strains of M types 1, 2, 4, 12, 42, 49, and 57 are associated with generating immune complexes in glomerulonephritis <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib11">(11)</link>. These immune complexes contain antibodies and their targeted specific GAS antigens, including M protein and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B. The deposition of these immune complexes in the glomerular capillaries triggers an inflammatory reaction, resulting in immune-mediated glomerular damage. Clinically, individuals, primarily children between 3 and 15 years old, present with edema, hypertension, and hematuria. This disease process is typically self-limited in children and adolescents. Adults who develop post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis are typically diabetics over 60 who tend to have more severe and prolonged renal impairment <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Individuals with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis have elevated anti-streptolysin O antibody titers and decreased complement levels. Penicillins have been the treatment of choice since the recognition in 1950 that penicillin treatment of GAS pharyngitis could reduce the risk of rheumatic fever <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Despite the use of penicillins for more than 70 years, resistant strains have not been reported <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Recently, two GAS isolates genetically related with reduced susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and cefotaxime have been reported <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib16">(16)</link>. Resistance is due to mutation in the <emphasis>pbp 2x</emphasis> gene (pbp = penicillin-binding protein). Data mining of 26,465 GAS genomes found 112 genomes with variation in <emphasis>pbp 2x</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib17">(17)</link>. The evolution to penicillin resistance in GAS will likely require accumulating mutations in <emphasis>pbp</emphasis> genes. The discovery of a GAS <emphasis>pbp 2x</emphasis> gene mutation that reduces penicillin susceptibility may herald the initial evolutionary steps to penicillin resistance in GAS. How long that evolutionary cycle to resistance might be is unknown. However, penicillin treatment failures of GAS pharyngitis are well described in the literature <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Whether that suggests that GAS strains with reduced susceptibility are more common than previously thought is unknown. For now, penicillins such as oral amoxicillin remain the drugs of choice.</para>
          <para>For patients allergic to penicillin, clindamycin and azithromycin are recommended as alternative agents<link linkend="ch0010s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Resistance to clindamycin and azithromycin is increasing, and resistant clones have been associated with GAS disease outbreaks. It is estimated that approximately 15% of isolates in the United States are resistant to these agents <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib19">(19)</link>.</para>
          <para>The most common mechanism that confers resistance to both clindamycin and azithromycin is the presence of the<emphasis>ermB</emphasis> gene. This gene encodes a methyltransferase that methylates the ribosomal binding site of clindamycin and azithromycin. This ribosomal binding site modification blocks the binding of those agents, rendering the organism resistant to them.</para>
          <para>Tetracycline resistance is also seen in approximately 15% of GAS isolates, while only 1% of GAS isolates are resistant to levofloxacin<link linkend="ch0010s0002bib19">(19)</link>. However, levofloxacin is not recommended for use in children and thus has little value in treating GAS pharyngitis.</para>
          <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  One of the forms of GAS pharyngitis is scarlet fever. Patients with scarlet fever typically have a blanching, papular, erythematous rash and “strawberry tongue” as well as pharyngitis <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib20">(20)</link>. The rash and strawberry tongue are due to an immune response to GAS superantigens, particularly streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and C (SpeA and SpeC). The <emphasis>emm</emphasis> types 1, 3, 4, and 12 have all been associated with recent outbreaks of scarlet fever <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib21">(21)</link>. In the 19th and 20th centuries, scarlet fever was a feared form of strep throat with a significant mortality rate <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib21">(21)</link>. In the 21st century, mortality due to scarlet fever is rare in the industrialized world <link linkend="ch0010s0002bib21">(21)</link>. However, cases have increased in England and East Asia, specifically Vietnam, South Korea, Hong Kong, and mainland China. Outbreaks of scarlet fever may be associated with outbreaks of invasive GAS disease, especially with <emphasis>emm</emphasis> types 1 and 3.</para>
