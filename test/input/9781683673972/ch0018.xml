        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The clinical presentation of a poorly controlled diabetic with localized headache and evidence of vision loss is consistent with a disease called rhinocerebral mucormycosis <link linkend="ch0018s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This infection is associated with significant mortality, and prompt surgical intervention is imperative because of its highly destructive nature.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  A frozen section biopsy is essentially as it sounds. A biopsy is obtained and the tissue is frozen at –20 to –30°C in a cryostat device; the tissue is then cut into thin sections, stained, and examined by a pathologist <link linkend="ch0018s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The time from receipt of the tissue specimen in the laboratory to diagnosis by the pathologist is ~30 minutes. However, that turnaround time may be extended if the diagnosis is not obvious and additional consultations with other pathologists are necessary. Because of the time frozen sections take, they are only used in limited clinical situations, such as ensuring clear margins in tumor removal. Multiple biopsies were done in this case because the surgeon was debriding necrotic tissue. The surgeon’s goal was to debride sufficiently to remove all infected tissue but limit the amount of tissue removed from the brain so as not affect neural function.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The identification of broad, ribbon-like hyphae with few septations (pauciseptate) on histology is consistent with molds in the order <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis>. In <link linkend="ch0018s0004fg01">Fig. 15.1</link>, characteristic hyphae (yellow arrows) are noted within the blood vessel (red arrows) and highlight the angioinvasive nature of these pathogens. The two most common <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis> genera are <emphasis>Rhizopus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Mucor</emphasis>. Clinically encountered <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis> are resistant to the antifungal agent voriconazole used to treat most mold infections so their accurate identification is critical. The culture of tissue obtained from a brain biopsy seen in <link linkend="ch0018s0004fg02">Fig. 15.2</link>, demonstrates characteristic fluffy, white, fast-growing (2 to 4 days) colonies with aerial hyphae that extend upwards to lift the lid off the plate. Invasion into the brain tissue is an ominous finding. This patient died 4 days after this surgery. Mortality from this infection varies, depending on the stage of infection at which the individual presents, but can be as high as 100% in certain immunosuppressed hosts.</para>
        <para role="listPara1">The <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis> are ubiquitous saprophytes in natural environments, especially decomposing organic matter. The organism reproduces by the production of conidia (spores). Individuals become infected by inhaling conidia from the environment. The conidia are trapped in the nasal turbinate. In most instances they are cleared, but in poorly controlled diabetics or people with malignancy, the conidia can germinate into fungal hyphae that may invade the sinuses and surrounding tissues. Because these fungi are both angioinvasive and rapidly growing, they can cause rapid necrosis in the tissue they infect by occluding blood vessels and causing thrombosis.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  In necrotic (infected) regions, blood flow is lost because of the occlusion and thrombosis in the vessel. Blockage of the right ophthalmic artery was believed to be responsible for the patient’s loss of vision in the right eye.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Invasive rhinocerebral fungal infections are most common in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis <link linkend="ch0018s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Experimental evidence suggests that the blood and tissues of patients in ketoacidosis contain more glucose and free iron, a key fungal nutrient available for the growth of the <emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis>. Well-controlled diabetics rarely develop this infection. It may also be seen in individuals receiving corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive biologics and those with hematologic malignancies, especially those who have received human stem cell transplants.</para>
