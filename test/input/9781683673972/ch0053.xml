      <sect1 id="ch0053s0004"><title>CASE 50</title><para>A 6-month-old, full-term unvaccinated infant presented from home during the summer months with a 5-day history of progressive hypotonia, poor oral intake, choking on food, constipation, and a weak cry. The parents became especially concerned the previous day when she was not crying with her usual vigor and was choking on her bottle, which she normally took. Since the previous night, she had only taken 2 oz. by mouth and had only one wet diaper. The patient’s baseline was sitting upright with minimal support, and she had not been able to sit up for the past day. In addition, they reported that she was less interactive than normal.</para>
      <para>The patient was breastfed and was introduced to solid foods 2 weeks prior. These included rice cereal, baby pouches of carrots and broccoli, teething crackers, and infant vitamin C, but there was no history of honey consumption. Her home was recently sprayed with pesticides.</para>
      <para>She had no exposure to soil and the family did not garden. The family reported construction in their neighborhood, although they had not taken their child for a walk outside around the time of symptom onset.</para>
      <para>The family worked in ministry and flew to New York the previous weekend for a church conference with the child. During the trip, there were no new foods or sick contacts. Both parents were unvaccinated for COVID-19.</para>
      <para>The child did not have fevers, congestion, diarrhea, or rash. Her last bowel movement was 8 days prior to admission.</para>
      <para>On physical examination, the child was fussy with a weak cry lying flat in the crib. Her cardiac, abdominal, and pulmonary examinations were normal. She did not have rhinorrhea or cervical lymphadenopathy. Conjunctivae were clear. A neurologic exam showed her diffusely hypotonic, unable to support her head. Pupillary reflex was present but fatigable with repetition. She did not have ptosis.</para>

        <title><emphasis role="color1">CASE DISCUSSION</emphasis>
        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with the syndrome of infant botulism. Key hallmarks of this syndrome present in this patient include constipation of greater than 3 days, progressive hypotonia, poor oral intake, diminished gag reflex (choking on food), inability to support her head, and a weak cry <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Infant botulism is typically seen in children less than 6 months of age <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib02">(2)</link>. It is caused by <emphasis>Clostridium botulinum</emphasis> and other related <emphasis>Clostridium</emphasis> spp. strains that can produce botulinum toxin. <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> is a spore-forming, anaerobic, Gram-positive bacillus primarily found in soil. The pathogenesis of infant botulism begins with ingesting toxigenic <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> spores from the patient’s environment. The spores germinate in the infant’s intestinal anaerobic environment, where vegetative cells grow and produce toxin. The toxin is absorbed across the intestinal mucosa into the bloodstream. The toxin specifically binds to skeletal and autonomic terminal nerve cells. The toxin enters the terminal nerve cells, where it enzymatically modifies proteins essential for releasing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These enzymatic modifications lead to the inhibition of acetylcholine release, essential for the contraction of skeletal and autonomic muscles (mainly gastrointestinal and respiratory), resulting in flaccid paralysis, consistent with the clinical signs and symptoms observed in this child <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  Breastfed infants are more likely to develop infant botulism than formula-fed ones, although disease in formula-fed infants tends to occur earlier and be more severe. The perturbation in the gut microbiota that occurs in the transition to solid foods (weaning) may create a permissive gut environment for the growth of <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis>. However, there are no strong data to support this. Her clinical presentation of being older (6 months), breastfed, and recently weaned all support the diagnosis of infant botulism. Honey contaminated with <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> was shown to be a source of infant botulism in 1977. By 1981, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that honey not be consumed by children less than 2 years old. As a result, the consumption of honey is rarely documented as an exposure in infants with botulism. Finally, disruption of soil due to gardening, nearby plowing, construction, earthquakes, or forest fires may result in aerosolization of <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> spores, which can be ingested. This child had no soil or honey exposure.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  BabyBIG (<link linkend="ch0053s0001fg01">Fig. 50.1</link>) is a human immunoglobulin preparation that neutralizes the most common serotypes of <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> toxin, A and B, that cause infant botulism <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib04">(4)</link>. It was produced by immunizing adult volunteers with serotype A and B recombinant botulinum toxin and purifying immunoglobulins from volunteers with high levels of neutralizing antibodies for the two toxin serotypes <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib05">(5)</link>.</para>

        <para>The antitoxins are given intravenously. They bind to serotype A and B botulinum toxin in the bloodstream, preventing it from binding and entering terminal nerve cells.</para>
        <para>The only source of BabyBIG in the United States is the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Center (IBTPC) at the California Department of Public Health. The IBTPC requires a clinical consultation with their staff, who determine if the clinical presentation is consistent with infant botulism<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib06">(6)</link>. When they judge that it is, they release the antitoxin for treatment.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The detection of botulinum toxin or toxigenic <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> in stool is the standard method for diagnosing infant botulism <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Because of its high sensitivity, detecting botulinum toxin by a mouse neutralization bioassay is the preferred diagnostic method. In addition, because this toxin is produced by toxigenic <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> in the infant gastrointestinal tract, a stool specimen is preferred for diagnosing infant botulism. In the mouse bioassay, sterile stool filtrates alone and stool filtrates incubated with antitoxin against all seven C. botulinum serotypes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) are injected into the mouse peritoneum. If the animals that receive sterile filtrate alone develop signs of botulism (typically paralysis and then death) and the ones that receive filtrate plus antitoxin do not, the patient is considered to have botulism toxin present; the specific serotype can be further determined by performing neutralization assays with type-specific antitoxins. This process may take several days to complete (in this case, 6 days). In addition, stool can be cultured for toxigenic <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis>. In this patient, her specimen was positive by mouse neutralization for toxin A, the most commonly encountered toxin type in infant botulism. Her culture was also positive for <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> producing toxin A.</para>
        <para>Collection of stool specimens from infants suspected of having infant botulism is often delayed because they are constipated and require stool to be collected by an enema with sterile, nonbacteriostatic water and not glycerin-containing suppositories. In most states, the stool specimen is sent to the CDC on ice (never frozen). State public health laboratories such as those in California and Pennsylvania do this testing because a high number of infant botulism cases occur there.</para>
        <para>There are two major reasons tertiary care medical centers are unable to test for C. botulinum. First, cases of botulism are quite rare, with &lt;500 cases in the United States annually. Given the disease’s rarity and the testing’s complexity, it would be a significant waste of resources for tertiary care medical centers to perform this testing. Second,<emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> is a select agent of bioterrorism, which requires the testing laboratory to have special licensure, training, and staff competency <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib08">(8)</link>. There are ample data suggesting that giving botulism antitoxin within 2 days of clinical presentation shortens length of stay, need for and time of mechanical ventilation, and mortality compared to administration of antitoxin more than 2 days after clinical presentation <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Only toxin present in the bloodstream is neutralized. Once botulinum toxin is internalized in target cells, it can no longer be neutralized. The longer it takes for the antitoxin to be given, the greater the number of botulinum toxin molecules entering target cells, resulting in more severe clinical disease, specifically paralysis of the respiratory system.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  The leading cause of death in cases of infant botulism is respiratory failure secondary to intoxication. The availability of mechanical ventilation has greatly reduced mortality in all forms of botulism <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib09">(9)</link>. If the patient had shown signs of increasing respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation would have been initiated.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Approximately 75% of children with infant botulism are hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). In a study of children who received BabyBIG, the length of hospital stay was an average of 18 days, intravenous or tube feeding lasted for an average of 27 days, and 40% required mechanical ventilation for an average of 13 days <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib04">(4)</link>. This child was discharged after 9 days, 5 days sooner than any patient receiving BabyBIG in the pivotal BabyBIG trial; was not mechanically ventilated; and required only 8 days of tube feeding, 19 days fewer than in the clinical trial <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Why the excellent outcome? First, the clinicians quickly recognized this very rare clinical syndrome. Second, they were able to access BabyBIG on the day of admission. This was serendipitous because the East Coast supply of BabyBIG was near the hospital where she received her care. It also speaks to the urgency of the clinicians and their colleagues who facilitated rapid antitoxin acquisition. Third, it is likely she was fortunate to have had a milder case of infant botulism although her syndrome was due to the more toxic toxin A-producing organism.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  The other naturally occurring clinical syndromes are foodborne botulism, wound botulism, and adult intestinal botulism. The diagnosis in these patients is typically made by detecting botulinum toxin in serum rather than in stool, although stool may be collected from patients with foodborne botulism and perhaps adult intestinal botulism <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Food-borne botulism</emphasis> is caused by the improper preparation of food, particularly smoked or salted meats and fish and improperly canned vegetables (<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib09">9</link>, <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib10">10</link>). Improper food preparation allows spores of toxigenic <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> to germinate and grow, producing botulinum toxin that contaminates the food. Botulinum toxin A is the most common toxin type seen in foodborne botulism, followed by B, E, and F. Death occurs in approximately 5% and depends on the amount of toxin consumed <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para>Two foodborne botulism outbreaks are illustrative of how larger outbreaks have occurred. One was a commercial hot dog chili product that resulted in 10 cases of botulism. An investigation found several violations of canning regulations that would allow <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> spores to survive and grow in the final product <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib11">(11)</link>. The outbreak investigators also found 23 swollen cans, the swelling likely due to the large amount of gas produced by <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> during growth in the cans’ anaerobic environment. Twenty of the 23 cans contained botulinum toxin. This discovery resulted in the recall of 111 million cans of the product.</para>
        <para>The second outbreak occurred in 23 people who consumed homemade potato salad at a church potluck picnic. The specific toxin source was improperly home-canned potatoes<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib12">(12)</link>.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">Wound botulism</emphasis> occurs when <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> from the environment contaminates necrotic tissue, producing botulinum toxin, which enters the bloodstream and eventually binds to terminal nerve cells. Approximately 30 cases of wound botulism are diagnosed in the United States annually. This is likely an underestimate. The manner by which this contamination most frequently occurs is during “skin popping” of black tar heroin, wherein <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> spores are introduced into subdermal tissue, where they germinate and begin producing toxin that subsequently enters the bloodstream <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib13">(13)</link>. The population in whom this is common is people experiencing homelessness who have limited access to health care. Patients with wound botulism may be diagnosed initially with drug overdose, stroke, myasthenia gravis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome, delaying treatment <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Delays in treatment increase length of stay, time requiring mechanical ventilation, and mortality.</para>
        <para>Fewer than 50 cases of<emphasis role="strong">adult intestinal botulism</emphasis> have been described in the literature <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib14">(14)</link>. It is more likely to occur in people with previous bowel surgery or abnormalities. It has also been observed in individuals with Crohn’s disease <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Like wound botulism, it can be confused with both myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barré syndrome.</para>
        <para>All three of these clinical syndromes are treated with an equine seven-valent botulinum antitoxin (HBAT)<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib15">(15)</link>. There are no double-blind, case-control efficacy trials of this product. Rather, there are safety and clinical outcome data on 162 patients, 113 of whom had a final diagnosis of botulism: 50% with foodborne, 28% with wound botulism, 2% with intestinal colonization, and 2% with iatrogenic botulism (see <phrase>answer to question 9</phrase> for greater detail). For the other approximately 20%, the clinical syndrome was either undetermined or not reported. Patients who received antitoxin within 2 days of diagnosis had shorter hospital stays, time in ICU, and time on mechanical ventilation than those who received antitoxin more than 2 days postdiagnosis.</para>
        <para>Because equine antitoxins have been associated with anaphylaxis, safety concerns are associated with this biological product. A review of the literature showed that of 305 pediatric and adult patients who have received HBAT, only 5 (1.6%) had an anaphylactic reaction<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib16">(16)</link>. None had a fatal reaction, suggesting an excellent safety profile for this product.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>Since the 2001 anthrax attacks, U. S. security and law enforcement agencies have been concerned about several microbial agents that could potentially be used as bioweapons<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib17">(17)</link>. These agents are called “select agents” <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib18">(18)</link>. Attempts have been made to weaponize <emphasis>C. botulinum</emphasis> toxin. One well-described, unsuccessful attempt was aerosol release of a toxin preparation into a subway station <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Animal studies suggested that aerosolization of botulinum toxin could result in the toxin being inhaled and absorbed into the bloodstream from the lung. This form of botulism is called “inhalational botulism” <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib19">(19)</link>. There are also concerns about using it as a bioweapon by injection (wound botulism) or contaminating food (foodborne botulism) <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib19">(19)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  Since botulinum toxin’s introduction as a human therapeutic agent in the 1980s, its use cosmetically and to treat pain and specific spastic conditions has been ever-increasing <link linkend="ch0053s0002bib03">(3)</link>. The FDA-approved indications include but are not limited to treating overactive bladder symptoms; preventing chronic migraines; and treating muscle stiffness in people with spasticity, cervical dystonia, strabismus, and blepharospasm.</para>
        <para>It is most widely used globally as a cosmetic therapy, and roughly half of all botulinum toxin is estimated to be used for this purpose. It is injected in minute amounts directly into the muscle that is targeted. Because such small amounts of toxin are injected, no pharmacokinetic data exist on its distribution. The assumption is that it remains in the injected muscle. There it has a biological effect for 4 to 6 months for skeletal muscles and longer for autonomic ones<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para>Although botulinum toxin is considered one of the most toxic substances to humans, adverse effects caused by properly administered botulinum toxin are rare in the medical literature. However, there are a wide variety of potential side effects described<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib20">(20)</link>.</para>
        <para>There has been one botulism outbreak following the injection for cosmetic purposes of a research preparation of botulinum toxin<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib21">(21)</link>. All individuals who received this preparation developed botulism and were hospitalized for extended periods of time. It is estimated that each individual received more than 2,800 lethal doses of botulinum toxin and had more than 20 lethal doses circulating in their blood.</para>
        <para>Another report described the development of botulism in two individuals after receiving a botulinum toxin injection at beauty parlors<link linkend="ch0053s0002bib22">(22)</link>. Therefore, only a licensed practitioner should use botulinum toxin therapeutically.</para>
