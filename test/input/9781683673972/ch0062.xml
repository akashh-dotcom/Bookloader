Four days prior, she had been seen in an outside clinic with complaints of fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, myalgia, and fatigue. She was told she had a viral syndrome and was sent home with supportive therapy. Two hours prior to her admission, the patient called a friend and asked to stay with the friend because she was not feeling well.

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  In any patient with influenza-like illness who presents with mental status changes and a travel history to sub-Saharan Africa, malaria must be ruled out. Of the five <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species that infect humans, <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> is the most likely to cause fatal infections <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  When this disease was first described, it was named malaria, which means “bad air.” The thinking well into the 19th century was that it was obtained by breathing in miasmas, or bad air. <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis>, the etiologic agent of malaria, is a vector-borne pathogen spread by the bite of female <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> mosquitoes. <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>, <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis>, <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis>, <emphasis>P. malariae</emphasis>, and P. knowlesi are the species that infect humans. The development of the infectious phase of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>, the sporozoite, in <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> mosquitoes occurs at 20°C or higher <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Below that temperature, gametocytes obtained during an <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> blood meal from a P. falciparum-infected host do not mate and produce infectious sporozoites. As a result, <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> is limited to tropical regions, with &gt;90% of global cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the consequences of global warming is the potential for an increased geographic range of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> as subtropical regions, including those in the southern continental United States, continue to warm. Two other common species that infect humans, <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis>, have a broader geographic range since they can sexually reproduce at lower temperatures (16<superscript>°</superscript>C or higher) and have a hypnozoite phase in the human liver where they may survive for months to years <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para>Malaria is both a childhood disease and a disease of poverty. Simple environmental control measures described in the<phrase>answer to question 3</phrase> have been shown to play an important role in reducing malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Most malaria deaths globally occur in rural areas among children less than 5 years old who are living in poverty, among whom effective environmental controls are economically unobtainable. Although adults living in areas of malaria endemicity may also be infected, the clinical disease tends to be less severe, likely due to acquired immunity from a previous infection. The exception is pregnant women, in whom malaria puts both the mother and especially her fetus at risk, with increases in rates of stillbirth, low-weight birth, and perinatal death of the child and increased likelihood of severe malaria, including cerebral malaria in the mother <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  Both chemoprophylaxis and environmental measures are important. Country-by-country malaria chemoprophylaxis recommendations are available at the CDC website <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib04">(4)</link>.</para>
        <para>All three widely used malaria prophylactic agents, doxycycline, mefloquine, and atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone), are recommended for the region of Africa this individual visited<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Which prophylactic agent is chosen by individuals is often based on cost, convenience of use, and potential side effects. The major preventive environmental measure is to avoid the bite by the <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> vector, the <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> mosquito. It feeds primarily at night, making evening and nighttime precautions particularly important. Measures to prevent exposure to this mosquito include staying in well-screened areas in the evening and night; using mosquito netting, preferably impregnated with insecticides, when sleeping; wearing clothing that covers the trunk and extremities; using insect repellent containing <emphasis>N, N</emphasis>-diethyl-<emphasis>m</emphasis>-toluamide (DEET); and spraying sleeping areas with insecticides <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib05">(5)</link>. These have played an important role in significantly reducing malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 3 decades, although increased resistance to insecticides used to impregnate mosquito netting is of significant concern.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The ring phase of the <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> trophozoites is infecting numerous RBCs. Ring phase morphology of the three most common <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species infecting humans, <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>, <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis>, and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis>, is used to differentiate them, with the delicate rings of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> being the most distinctive and easily recognized. The findings of multiple rings in a single cell (see cell with arrow in <link linkend="ch0062s0004fg01">Fig. 59.1</link>) and &gt;2% of RBCs infected are also consistent with <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>. Species identification is important because antimalarial treatment is different for <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> than for <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib06">(6)</link>. <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> acquired in Africa is considered chloroquine-resistant. As a result, it is treated with the oral agents artemether-lumefantrine, an artemisinin combination therapy; atovaquone-proguanil; mefloquine; or quinine and either a tetracycline or clindamycin <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib07">(7)</link>. <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> acquired in most regions of the world are considered to be chloroquine susceptible and can be treated with oral chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib06">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib07">7</link>). Because both parasites have a hypnozoite liver stage, they should also be treated with either primaquine or tafenoquine, which are active against this stage <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Parasitemia of 2% or greater is associated with severe clinical disease and is typically only seen with <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The reason is <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> can infect all types of RBCs, while <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> only infect immature RBCs called reticulocytes, which comprise approximately 2% of RBCs in an adult. Therefore, parasitemia of 2% is highly unusual with <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> or <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> and, in those species, indicates severe infections. Parasitemia of 30% is highly unusual, even in the case of severe <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> infection. The patient's clinical presentation of altered mental status with evidence of anemia (hemoglobin of 8.7 mg/dl and scleral icterus), renal insufficiency (creatinine of 2.5 mg/dl), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (platelet count of 66,000/μl) are all consistent with cerebral malaria, the most severe clinical manifestation of an overwhelming <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> infection <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para>The pathogenesis of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> begins with the bite of an infected female <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> mosquito <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The sporozoite stage of the parasite is present in the mosquito's salivary gland and enters the bite wound via the mosquito's saliva. From there, the sporozoites are carried by the bloodstream to infect hepatocytes. The parasites multiply in the hepatocytes and are released into the bloodstream as the merozoite phase. The merozoite phase then infects erythrocytes. As the <emphasis>P</emphasis>. <emphasis>falciparum</emphasis> parasites mature in RBCs, knobs develop on the surface of these cells. A malaria-derived protein found on the surface of the infected RBCs (<emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> erythrocyte membrane protein-1 [PfEMP1]) is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of malaria. PfEMP1 mediates the adherence of infected RBCs to endothelial cells in the microvasculature of the brain, kidney, lung, and other organs. In addition, it is thought to be responsible for the rosetting of uninfected RBCs to infected ones. The result of infected RBCs binding to the endothelial cells and the rosetting of uninfected RBCs is a process known as sequestration. Sequestration is believed to obstruct the microvasculature in the central nervous system, lungs, and kidneys <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>. This obstruction along with the production of increasing levels of cytokines induced by the infection are thought to play central roles in cerebral malaria and acute respiratory distress syndrome, two potentially fatal manifestations of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> infection. Consequences of this blockage include decreases in glucose and oxygen levels in the brain tissue. Similar microvascular blockage in the kidney, coupled with high levels of circulating hemoglobin, is thought to cause renal failure seen in <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>-infected patients.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Intravenous (IV) artesunate is the therapy of choice for severe <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> infection, in part because this drug rapidly kills the trophozoite form of the parasite (<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib08">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib09">9</link>). IV artesunate was approved for use by the FDA in 2020, although its efficacy for severe malaria was demonstrated almost 2 decades previously (<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib10">10</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib11">11</link>). At the time of this case, IV artesunate was only available from the CDC through compassionate release, a highly bureaucratic and time-consuming process in place for “experimental” therapies. Given the severity of her illness, IV quinidine was chosen as her treatment.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  The idea behind her exchange transfusion is a simple one, to reduce the infectious burden of parasites by the removal of infected RBCs and to remove toxic by-products of the infection from the bloodstream. There has never been a prospective, case-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of exchange transfusion in part because this procedure is rarely done and the ethics of doing such a study are questionable. The largest data review of exchange transfusion written by CDC scientists indicates that there is no benefit to exchange transfusion, although the data on which this recommendation is based have limitations <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib12">(12)</link>. As a result, the CDC does not recommend exchange transfusion as an adjunct therapy for severe malaria <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Because of the limitations of the CDC study, the American Association for Apheresis still recommends exchange transfusion, especially in those with parasitemia greater than 10% <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib14">(14)</link>. With the approval of IV artesunate, which has a median parasite clearance time of 20 hours, a reassessment of exchange transfusions is appropriate.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  The finding of increased parasitemia after the initial transfusion is not surprising for two reasons. First, infected RBCs are sequestered on the surface of endothelial cells. These are not removed during exchange transfusion and provide a ready reservoir to infect the new RBCs that are present as a result of the transfusion. Second, the therapy she was receiving, quinidine, has a mean clearance time of 49 hours, so the antimicrobial had not had sufficient time to kill the parasite <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  By the second transfusion, the patient had been treated with quinidine for close to 48 hours, the median parasite clearance time. By that time, the parasite burden had been reduced by 90%; she continued to clear the parasite during the intervening, post-exchange hour.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Severe malaria is seen in two distinct patient populations: travelers from regions of nonendemicity who travel to regions where malaria is endemic and young children who live in regions of malaria endemicity <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The reason these two patient populations have similar disease courses and are most prone to severe disease is that both groups tend to be “immunologic virgins” without prior exposure to <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis>. Adults in regions of malaria endemicity have some level of immunity due to repeated exposure to the parasite. Consequently, they tend to have mild or subclinical infections. An exception would be adults living with advanced HIV disease, in whom the severity of disease is influenced by CD4 counts.</para>
        <para>Pregnant women, especially during their initial pregnancy, are at increased risk for severe infection, primarily to their fetus, especially in the first trimester. The reason for this is that <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>expresses a specific protein, VAR2 CSA, on the surface of infected RBCs that allows sequestration of the parasite in the placenta, from which it can infect the fetus<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>. If this occurs in the first trimester, fetal demise may occur. Other fetal and neonatal complications of placental malaria include stillbirth, low birth weight, cognitive and neurosensory delay, and perinatal death.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  Because of the nonspecific clinical presentation of malaria infections, the availability of rapid diagnostic testing for <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> is an essential tool in preventing, controlling, and treating malaria infections. Although microscopy may be thought of as a “low-tech” diagnostic approach, malaria is particularly problematic in rural, tropical regions with little modern infrastructure or trained personnel to support the use of a microscope or staining of slides. The development of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect malaria antigen makes training, deployment, and performance of these tests in rural health settings highly functional <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib14">(14)</link>. RDTs detect specific antigens of different <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> species, with a specific focus on antigens of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>. The tests require a drop of blood applied to a nitrocellulose strip, similar to a pregnancy test. The blood is lysed, and specific <emphasis>Plasmodium</emphasis> antigens migrate on the strip until they encounter impregnated antibodies that bind these antigens. The antibody-antigen complex can be detected by an enzymatic reaction. This testing approach is rapid, taking no more than 15 minutes. It is much easier and generally more accurate than the traditional thin and thick malaria blood smears. The RDT sensitivity for <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> detection is higher (&gt;95%) than for <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> (81–86%) and is significantly lower for <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> (5–75%) and <emphasis>P. malariae</emphasis> (14-90%) <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib15">(15)</link>. The high RDT sensitivity for <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> is due to detection of an antigen specific for that parasite, HRP2.</para>
        <para>These tests have resulted in improved use of appropriate antimalarial drugs for both treatment and community prophylaxis while also signaling the need for aggressive use of environmental controls<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Globally it is estimated that 60 to 75% of malaria testing is done using this technology.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">12.</emphasis>  Because most deaths due to malaria occur in children less than 5 years of age, it suggests that those who survive beyond that age have developed some level of immunity. Malaria infections in adults in areas of endemicity are typically mild or subclinical <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib01">(1)</link>.</para>
        <para>Progress in developing a malaria vaccine has been slow, in part because of the exceedingly complex life cycle of the parasite. Several different vaccine strategies have been proposed. The World Health Organization recommends a recombinant vaccine derived from the major surface protein of the infective stage of the parasite, the sporozoite for children under 5<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib16">(16)</link>. The target antigen is a polypeptide of circumsporozoite protein that has been fused with hepatitis B surface antigen. This vaccine has been referred to as the RTS, S/AS01 vaccine. Unfortunately, the vaccine does have its critics because the long-term (48 months) efficacy of the vaccine is modest, at &lt;40% (<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib17">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib18">18</link>). A sec ond candidate, R21, a modification of the RTS vaccine, has shown encouraging results, with 1-year efficacy of 77% <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib16">(16)</link>. A novel approach of using mRNA vaccines against several different malarial protein targets is being investigated in animal models <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib16">(16)</link>. These studies show promise but are far from phase 3 human clinical trials. In addition, the cost of mRNA vaccines requires significant financial support from the industrialized world to fund its use in low-income countries where these vaccines are most needed.</para>
        <para>One of the challenges in developing sporozoite-based vaccines is the need to induce immunity such that the parasite is eliminated before it enters the hepatocyte. Once the sporozoite enters the hepatocyte and develops into merozoites, it undergoes significant antigen variation, making it unlikely that the immune response generated by this vaccine will be effective at the next stage of the disease.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">13.</emphasis>  Most cases of <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> can be successfully treated in the early, clinically mild infection phase with oral artemisinin-based combination therapy or other alternative therapies (<link linkend="ch0062s0002bib08">8</link>, <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib19">19</link>). Unfortunately, when this patient presented 4 days prior to her hospital admission with complaints of fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, myalgia, and fatigue, a travel history was apparently not taken. The clinical presentation of malaria is nonspecific, especially in the initial stages of infection. Careful history-taking is needed to uncover risk factors for this infection, the primary one being travel to areas where malaria is endemic. To determine if malaria is endemic in a particular country and the species most likely to be encountered, one can consult the CDC <link linkend="ch0062s0002bib04">(4)</link>. </para>
        <para>Since the patient was a college student being seen at the end of her summer break, a question such as “What did you did this summer?” should have elicited her travel history. With the growing interest in global health among pre-health and -medical students in the industrialized world, travel to areas where malaria is endemic is becoming more common. “Adventure tourists” also are traveling with increasing frequency to these areas. Their activities and primitive accommodations increase their risk of malaria infection.</para>
        <para>In the author's personal experience, all cases of cerebral malaria have been in individuals who traveled to sub-Saharan Africa, were seen at urgent care or student health clinics, and presented with influenza-like illness, which includes fever, headache, and myalgia. None had travel histories elicited, although all three had recent travel to an area in sub-Saharan Africa where <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> is endemic. All were diagnosed with viral syndromes and discharged only to subsequently present with cerebral malaria. The patient presented in this case is the only one of the three to survive.</para>

The parasite is spread from human to human by an insect vector, female <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> mosquitoes. It is a disease of tropical and subtropical regions of the world.</para>

          <listitem id="ch0062s0003x34">
            <para><emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> is the most common and clinically important species, limited to tropical regions of the world because it does not have a hypnozoite liver phase, and most likely to cause fulminant disease and death because of its ability to infect multiple forms of RBCs and to adhere to endothelial cells.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem id="ch0062s0003x35">
            <para><emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> are less frequent causes but still clinically important, found in both tropical and subtropical regions because they can be transmitted at lower temperatures and their hypnozoite liver phase can survive in the human host for months to years. These parasites only infect reticulocytes. As such, fulminant disease is less common but may occur.</para>

            <para>Malaria, a systemic, febrile illness with flu-like symptoms of fever, headache, and myalgia, is frequently misdiagnosed in the industrialized world if a careful travel history is not obtained. If the person is infected with <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis>, this misdiagnosis can lead to severe disease manifested by anemia, organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma (due to cerebral infection), and death.</para>

          <listitem id="ch0062s0003x38">
            <para>Diagnosis in high-income countries is done by examining a blood smear for trophozoite ring forms that can differentiate <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> from <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis>. Differentiating these species is important because <emphasis>P. falciparum</emphasis> should be treated with artemisinin combination therapy while <emphasis>P. vivax</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. ovale</emphasis> are treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as well as primaquine or tafenoquine to treat the hypnozoite stage of these parasites.</para>

            <para>For people traveling to areas of malaria endemicity, chemoprophylaxis and environmental controls to prevent exposure to <emphasis>Anopheles</emphasis> mosquito bites are required prophylactic measures. For individuals living in these areas, similar chemoprophylaxis and environmental approaches are also recommended. In addition, childhood vaccination for malaria shows promise but is nowhere near as efficacious as any other globally used childhood vaccinations.</para>
