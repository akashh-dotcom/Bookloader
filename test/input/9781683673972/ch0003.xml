      <para>The idea for this book was based on a lunch conversation in the late 1980s I had with my wife, M. Lynn Smiley, an infectious disease physician and coauthor of the first three editions of this book. She challenged me to explain why the medical students rounding with her didn’t seem “to know any microbiology.” This was an uncomfortable conversation for me, as I had taught these same students in their microbiology course during their second medical school year. From previous teaching experiences, I knew that using case histories was a popular way to teach medical microbiology. Convincing the microbiology faculty to devote a significant amount of teaching time to this novel, untried teaching approach was daunting for a junior faculty member. They agreed and “case studies” became a microbiology teaching tool at our medical school. Case-based learning is now a curriculum centerpiece in the first 2 years at the UNC School of Medicine.</para>
      <para>With its initial classroom success, we approached ASM Press with the idea for this book. Under the tutelage of Patrick Fitzgerald, the head of the books program at that time,<emphasis>Cases in Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases</emphasis> was born. Ellie Tupper, the ASM Press production editor at the time, taught us how to create a book. For those two individuals, I am forever grateful.</para>
      <para>For the fifth edition of the book, we would first like to thank our editor, Megan Angelini, for keeping us on track during an extremely trying time in the microbiology community—the COVID-19 pandemic—which greatly delayed this edition. As he did with the fourth edition, Mark Via did a yeoman’s job of copyediting, making the text clear and organized. Any shortcomings in the writing of this text are solely the responsibility of the authors.</para>
      <para>Case material used in this text is drawn from infectious disease conferences, clinical pathology conferences, and laboratories rounds discussions. To try to list all the people who have contributed material in this way is not possible for fear of leaving out deserving individuals. To all of you, we are grateful. The authors would like to thank Sixto Leal, MD, PhD, one of Dr. Miller’s and my previous clinical pathology residents who contributed figures and case materials.</para>
      <para>We would like to thank the Lee family, who helped us unravel the 20-year history of their son Al. His story teaches two things: first, the courage and commitment to the long-term care of a cystic fibrosis patient—not only by the patient but by an entire family—and second, the power of medical research to unravel the hidden secrets of disease and to create new treatments that improve both the quality and quantity of life.</para>
      <para>We would also like to thank the many unidentified individuals and their families whose stories we have told here.</para>
      <para>I personally would like to thank Andrea Prinzi and Kyle Rodino. Both started their microbiology careers as bench-level clinical laboratory scientists. Both have ascended to leadership roles in the discipline. Their work is a testament to their writing skills, scientific knowledge, and commitment to bringing this text to fruition.</para>
      <para>Melissa Miller’s commitment to this text has been remarkable. She was a key leader of the clinical microbiology community during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic with untold hours spent working with the press to educate the general public. I am proud that I get to “pass the baton” to her in this fifth edition. She is a skilled scientist and teacher, a wonderful writer, and one of the best people I know.</para>
      <para>Finally, and most importantly, all the authors of the five editions would like to thank the many thousands of students and faculty who have learned—or will learn—from this text. Using the knowledge gained, we hope that in ways both large and small, they were—and are—better able to provide care for their communities.</para>
