He was recently weaned off his daytime oxygen requirements, but still received 0.25 liter/minute at night. Three days ago, he presented to an outside hospital with a cough and was determined to have mild hypoxemia. His chest radiograph was concerning for atelectasis versus pneumonia. He was given ceftriaxone and hydrocortisone and sent home.</para>

        </title>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  Due to the concern for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ceftriaxone was given. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society recommends the use of a cephalosporin for hospitalized infants and children who are not fully vaccinated or have life-threatening infections <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The most common pathogens in a patient this age would be <emphasis>Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> and <emphasis>Haemophilus influenzae</emphasis>. Ceftriaxone covers both penicillin-resistant <emphasis>S. pneumoniae</emphasis> and beta-lactamase-positive <emphasis>H. influenzae</emphasis>. Otherwise, ampicillin would be the preferred antimicrobial.</para>
        <para>With bronchiolitis, significant inflammation and airway edema may occur, leading to airway obstruction. Therefore, hydrocortisone was administered as an anti-inflammatory agent. The use of corticosteroids in this clinical setting is controversial, with large multicenter trials not showing a positive effect<link linkend="ch0014s0002bib02">(2)</link>. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend routine use of corticosteroids, but they were used in this high-risk patient <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib03">(3)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The differential diagnosis for this patient’s bronchiolitis included respiratory viruses such as the parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, coronaviruses (including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]), rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and RSV. <emphasis>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</emphasis> or <emphasis>Bordetella pertussis</emphasis> also could have caused his illness. RSV causes ~70% of bronchiolitis cases in children &lt;2 years of age, with more severe cases typically occurring in children &lt;6 months of age and premature infants.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  There are several diagnostic approaches that offer a rapid result. Rapid enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), or rapid antigen tests, offer results in ~15 minutes. However, these tests can have sensitivities as low as 8% in infants <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib04">(4)</link> and 59% overall <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib05">(5)</link>. They have also been shown to be a source of significant false-positive results, particularly at the beginning and end of RSV season, due to the decreased prevalence and positive predictive value <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib06">(6)</link>. The advantage of the EIA method is that it is easy to perform and may be available in physician offices.</para>
        <para>More recently, molecular methods have become commercially available to diagnose respiratory infections. Most of these tests detect a panel of respiratory pathogens, including RSV. Some detect only influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, while others detect 12 or more respiratory viruses and bacteria. The time to result for these molecular platforms can be as short as 15 to 45 minutes, and some are CLIA-waived, meaning they can be performed in a doctor’s office. The main advantage of molecular detection of RSV is increased sensitivity. The primary obstacle in routinely performing these tests in the clinical laboratory is the cost of the equipment, reagents, and personnel needed to perform molecular testing. Given the broad differential for bronchiolitis in an infant, a syndromic approach (i. e., larger multiplex panel that detects a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens) is reasonable. Further, the patient is sick enough to require hospitalization, so test cost and reimbursement is less of a concern than it might be in the outpatient setting. Independent of the method used to diagnose RSV in the laboratory, a rapid result is important for management decisions, including infection control and treatment. Additionally, rapid detection of respiratory viruses may decrease unnecessary use of antibiotics and decrease length of hospital stay (<link linkend="ch0014s0002bib07">7</link>, <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib08">8</link>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  First, RSV must bind and enter the target cells, which are the apical ciliated epithelial cells of the airway lumen. The virus attaches to the cell membrane using electrostatic interactions and the viral G protein. Then the viral F protein, along with a cellular receptor, mediates fusion to the cell membrane and thereby viral entry. The fusion protein also causes neighboring cells to coalesce, resulting in multinucleated cells, or syncytia (where the virus gets its name) <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib09">(9)</link>. The result of the infection is damage to the airway epithelium and loss of ciliated epithelial cells. Histopathologic evidence shows sloughed epithelial cells, fibrin, mucus, and inflammatory cells in the large airways. <emphasis>In vivo</emphasis> evidence of apoptosis and syncytia formation has also been noted. Only recently, with the use of the well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cell culture model, has RSV pathogenesis started to be understood. In this model, much of the RSV-infected epithelium remains intact; this has also been observed <emphasis>in vivo</emphasis>. These observations suggest that airway damage is not a direct effect of RSV but rather is caused by the immune response to RSV. RSV infection induces an innate immune response leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines by the epithelium, which recruits white blood cells and results in epithelial injury. The resulting necrosis and edema can lead to collapse and blockage of the small-diameter bronchioles, with air trapping distally causing the wheezing and stridulous cough that are often seen in infants with RSV infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  RSV is the most important viral etiology of childhood respiratory illness in the industrialized world in terms of morbidity and mortality, particularly in infants &lt;1 year old. In the United States, the CDC estimates RSV infection is responsible for 2.1 million outpatient visits, 58,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations, and 100 to 300 deaths annually in children &lt;5 years old <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Globally, an estimated 1 in 50 deaths in children &lt;5 years old and 1 in every 28 deaths in children aged 28 days to 6 months are attributable to RSV <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib11">(11)</link>. Approximately two-thirds of infants have an RSV infection during the first year of life, with nearly all children infected by the end of the second year. Clinical manifestations of RSV infection range from mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe lower respiratory tract illness, including bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia. Lower airway disease occurs in 15 to 50% of young children, with approximately 1 to 3% requiring hospitalization. Premature infants, infants with chronic lung disease, and infants with significant congenital heart disease have hospitalization rates four to five times higher than healthy infants.</para>
        <para>Incomplete protective immunity following RSV infection leads to reinfections throughout life. Reinfections in older children and adults generally result in minimal respiratory tract symptoms. However, immunocompromised individuals, patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease, and the elderly who reside in long-term care facilities are at greater risk for developing severe lower respiratory tract disease. The CDC estimates 60,000 to 160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000 to 10,000 deaths annually in adults ≥65 years old<link linkend="ch0014s0002bib10">(10)</link>.</para>
        <para>RSV is spread by large respiratory droplets and on fomites. In hospitals, day care centers, and long-term care facilities, it can be spread to susceptible individuals on the hands of caregivers who do not use good handwashing practices. Although there is only one serotype of RSV, it has two antigenically distinct subgroups, designated A and B. RSV-A and RSV-B cocirculate during epidemics, although one type tends to predominate. Both epidemiologic and<emphasis>in vitro</emphasis> data have suggested that RSV-A causes more severe disease. However, the antigenic heterogeneity that occurs within the subgroups makes this hypothesis difficult to confirm.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  Prior to 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, seasonal patterns of RSV were predictable (<link linkend="ch0014s0002bib10">10</link>). RSV season started in the fall (mid-September to mid-November) and peaked in the winter (late December to mid-February). RSV season was completely absent in the fall/winter of 2020-2021; it began circulating again in the spring of 2021, peaking in July (<link linkend="ch0014s0001fg01">Fig. 11.1</link>). The disruption of RSV activity was likely due to the public health measures implemented to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib12">(12)</link>.</para>

        <para>Infants at risk for severe RSV disease were recommended to receive passive immunoprophylaxis with a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody (palivizumab)<link linkend="ch0014s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Although expensive, palivizumab has been shown to decrease hospitalization rates by 50% and total wheezing days in the first year of life by 61%. Historically, at-risk infants received five monthly doses of palivizumab during RSV season, November through March. This included infants/children &lt;24 months old with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease and infants &lt;12 months old who were born prematurely or had congenital abnormality or neuromuscular condition of the airway. The atypical summer spike of RSV in 2021 led to challenges in obtaining insurance approval for palivizumab, leaving a very vulnerable population at risk. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued interim guidance on the use of palivizumab in the “off” season of RSV, which was subsequently updated to include recommendations for prolonged seasons of RSV (<link linkend="ch0014s0002bib14">14</link>, <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib15">15</link>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  In 2023, two new recombinant protein vaccines were approved to protect adults ≥60 years old from lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease due to RSV <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib16">(16)</link>. The vaccines were found to reduce LRT disease by more than 80%. One of the vaccines (RSVpreF) was also approved for use in pregnant women at 32 to 36 weeks’ gestation to prevent LRT disease in infants &lt;6 months old; it is recommended to be given seasonally (<link linkend="ch0014s0002bib17">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib18">18</link>). In addition, a new long-acting monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab) was approved to protect young children (&lt;24 months old) at risk for severe RSV disease <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib19">(19)</link>. Nirsevimab was shown to reduce severe disease by ~80%. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends the use of nirsevimab for infants &lt;8 months old who are born during or just prior to RSV season, or for children 8 to 19 months old who are at increased risk for severe disease due to RSV and are entering their second RSV season. Unlike palivizumab, which requires monthly dosing, nirsevimab only requires a single administration. Unfortunately, during the first RSV season postapproval, nirsevimab was in short supply. This shortage led to recommendations <link linkend="ch0014s0002bib20">(20)</link> to prioritize nirsevimab for use in infants in the highest risk groups, continue palivizumab when appropriate, and encourage maternal vaccination.</para>
