        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The target blood sugar for a preprandial diabetic patient is 80 to 130 mg/dl <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib02">(2)</link>. Her glucose level was twice that, suggesting that her blood sugar levels were not well controlled. Poorly controlled diabetes is associated with neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, cardiac disease, and stroke.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  The combination of peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy, a common finding in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes, can result in chronic ulcer formation <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib03">(3)</link>. Peripheral vascular disease can result in localized ischemia. The resulting poor tissue perfusion can lead to tissue necrosis and ulcer formation. Individuals with peripheral neuropathy may not notice traumatic injury to the foot because of the lack of sensation. Because the injury is unnoticed, proper wound care such as cleansing and covering the wound may not occur, increasing the likelihood of developing an infection. The immune response may also be delayed because of poor peripheral perfusion, leading to chronic infection.</para>
        <para>Chronic foot infections are a serious complication of diabetes and are a common reason for individuals with diabetes to visit the ED or be admitted to the hospital<link linkend="ch0038s0002bib04">(4)</link>. It is estimated that as many as half of diabetic foot ulcers become infected. As many as 20% of patients with moderate to severe chronic foot infections will require some type of amputation. Five-year mortality in these individuals exceeds 70%.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  As discussed in <link linkend="ch0038s0004x02">question 2</link>, this individual had significant peripheral vascular disease, which can result in chronic foot infections. One of the characteristics of peripheral vascular disease is foot ulcers. When infected, as occurred in this patient, the center of the ulcer is necrotic <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Necrotic tissue is often malodorous. However, the daughter’s report that the foot smelled “horribly” suggests that infection with a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria should be considered. Anaerobes produce short, branched-chained fatty acids, which are particularly malodorous. If clinicians find the wound particularly malodorous, they should consider empiric antimicrobials that are effective against anaerobes.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  The organisms most commonly associated with diabetic foot infections are <emphasis>Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>, including methicillin-resistant <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis> (MRSA); beta-hemolytic streptococci, particularly <emphasis>Streptococcus agalactiae</emphasis> (group B streptococci); other staphylococci; and Gram-negative bacilli including <emphasis>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, <emphasis>Escherichia coli</emphasis>, <emphasis>Klebsiella pneumoniae</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Proteus</emphasis> spp. Anaerobic bacteria may also be recovered <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib05">(5)</link>. If the patient has received prior antimicrobial treatment for a diabetic foot infection, the concern for the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms such as MRSA or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase or carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli should be increased. There is an emerging school of thought that these infections are frequently due to a mixture of bacteria growing as a mixed-organism biofilm <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib06">(6)</link>. A biofilm mode of growth is often refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Due to this, wound debridement is central to infection resolution. Unfortunately, the combination of antimicrobial therapy and wound debridement in the setting of severe peripheral vascular disease may eventually result in amputation because antimicrobials do not penetrate the site of infection, and debridement may only slow but not cure the infection.</para>
        <para>This microbial differential diagnosis of this case was narrowed by the observation that this woman was frequently scratched and bitten by pet cats. The most common cause of infection following cat bites is <emphasis>Pasteurella multocida</emphasis>, a Gram-negative bacillus frequently found as a predominant member of the oral microbiota in feline animals <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib07">(7)</link>. Because cats have sharp, slender teeth, which allow them to introduce these organisms into deep tissue, the organism can cause severe damage to tendons, ligaments, and bone and is associated with tenosynovitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The etiologic agent of cat scratch disease (i. e.,<emphasis>Bartonella henselae</emphasis>) would also need to be considered, although the clinical presentation would be significantly different.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  The presentation seen here is consistent with cellulitis, which is inflammation (red, warm to the touch) of skin and soft tissue. The most common etiologies of cellulitis are <emphasis>S. aureus</emphasis>, including MRSA and group A streptococci (<emphasis>Streptococcus pyogenes</emphasis>) <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib08">(8)</link>. However, <emphasis>P. multocida</emphasis> is the most common cellulitis etiology following a cat bite or scratch <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib07">(7)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The radiology report suggests that the patient may have osteomyelitis. A plain film is not the optimum imaging study for the detection of osteomyelitis. Rather, magnetic resonance imaging is superior for the detection of osteomyelitis in individuals with diabetic foot ulcers <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib05">(5)</link>. An ESR level of &gt;100 mm/hour is suggestive of an osteomyelitis diagnosis, as is the patient’s elevated white cell count <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib09">(9)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>  Because of a high index of suspicion for osteomyelitis based on imaging and a high white blood cell count and ESR, determining the etiology of her infection would inform the antimicrobial therapy she would receive. The evidence for the recommended treatment for osteomyelitis secondary to chronic diabetic foot infection is very limited. The recommended length of therapy can be anywhere from 1 week to 3 months, depending on the severity and etiology of the infection <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib05">(5)</link>. Thus, selecting the appropriate antimicrobial is essential to limit the length of treatment to avoid complications associated with long-term antimicrobial therapy, such as <emphasis>Clostridioides difficile</emphasis> infection.</para>
        <para>The appropriate specimen for determining the etiology of an individual infection is a tissue biopsy<link linkend="ch0038s0002bib10">(10)</link>. Swabs of the wound surface are insensitive and nonspecific, often positive for a mixture of bacteria that are part of the skin microbiota colonizing the ulcer surface. The organism causing the infection will be in deep tissue on the ulcer’s edge. Biopsy in this ulcer region will have the highest and most specific diagnostic yield. Blood cultures are highly specific as a diagnostic tool for osteomyelitis but have a very low sensitivity of &lt;20% <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib11">(11)</link>. The low sensitivity is likely due to patients receiving antimicrobials prior to culture.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  When positive, a Gram stain from a tissue biopsy can be useful in determining the infection's etiology. The Gram stain shows pleiomorphic, Gram-negative bacilli and polymorphonuclear cells. The most common pleiomorphic, Gram-negative bacilli encountered in clinical specimens are members of the genera <emphasis>Haemophilus</emphasis> and <emphasis>Moraxella</emphasis>. However, these two genera are typically associated with respiratory tract infections rather than wounds. The history of the patient having multiple cats that bit and scratched her alerted the clinician to the fact that these traumatic events might have been the source of her infection. Since <emphasis>P. multocida</emphasis> is a pleiomorphic, Gram-negative bacillus and the most common cause of infections following cat bites and scratches, it was the most likely cause of her infection. Since some beta-lactamase-producing, anaerobic, Gram-negative rods should also be considered but were much less likely, the continuation of the beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor was prudent, especially since <emphasis>P. multocida</emphasis> is susceptible to that drug combination.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  <emphasis>P. multocida</emphasis>is an oxidase-positive, pleiomorphic, Gram-negative bacillus that grows on sheep blood and chocolate agars but not Mac Conkey agar. The organism ferments glucose and sucrose, so it will give an acid/acid reaction on a TSI slant. The organism is also spot indole positive. Based on these laboratory tests, the organism was identified as P. multocida. Large hospitals, academic medical centers, and commercial reference laboratories likely use matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectroscopy to identify <emphasis>Pasteurella</emphasis> because it is highly accurate <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Laboratories in smaller hospitals especially in middle- and low-income countries will use conventional approaches described above.</para>
        <para><emphasis>P. multocida</emphasis> is typically susceptible to all beta-lactam drugs active against Gram-negative organisms. The IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) recommends the use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors for treatment of chronic foot infections, so the physician was following those guidelines <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib05">(5)</link>. An antimicrobial stewardship team might choose to de-escalate to a narrower antimicrobial treatment to reduce the risk of <emphasis>C. difficile</emphasis> infection.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">10.</emphasis>  Dog bites are responsible for approximately 80 to 90% of bite wound ED visits <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib01">(1)</link>. These bites occur primarily in males. Cat bites, as seen in this case, are responsible for 5 to 15% of bite wound ED visits. These are most likely to occur in adult females. Humans are responsible for approximately 2 to 3% of bite wound ED visits. There are two common types of human bite wound injuries <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib01">(1)</link>. One is closed-hand injuries in which a person’s hand is injured when striking someone in the mouth. This occurs primarily in adult males. Human bite wounds may also occur when children bite fingers or soft tissues of others. </para>
        <para>The most common pathogens in dog bites are <emphasis>Pasteurella canis</emphasis> and <emphasis>P. multocida</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib07">(7)</link>. An organism associated with sepsis following dog bites is <emphasis>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</emphasis>, a fastidious, slow-growing, oxidase-positive, Gram-negative bacillus that requires increased CO<subscript>2</subscript> for growth <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib13">(13)</link>. Sepsis due to <emphasis>C. canimorsus</emphasis> occurs primarily in individuals who have had a splenectomy or have cirrhosis of the liver. The mortality associated with this infection is 25%.</para>
        <para>Most bite wound infections following human bites are secondary to closed-fist injuries.<emphasis>Eikenella corrodens</emphasis> is a common pathogen found in osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and tenosynovitis secondary to human bites <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib01">(1)</link>. It is a fastidious, oxidase-positive, Gram-negative bacillus that has a characteristic bleach odor with colonies that pit the agar.</para>
        <para>HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus have all been shown to be transmitted by human bites (<link linkend="ch0038s0002bib01">1</link>, <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib07">7</link>).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">11.</emphasis>  The rabies virus is responsible for an estimated 60,000 deaths a year globally, primarily in Africa and Asia, with half the deaths occurring in children <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib14">(14)</link>. It is estimated that 20,000 rabies deaths occur in India alone. Over 99% of human rabies is transmitted from dogs in low- and middle-income countries. People such as missionaries and aid and health care workers who will be spending extended periods of time in rural areas of Africa and Asia, where dogs may roam more freely, should consider being vaccinated against rabies. If not vaccinated, they should have a contingency plan of how to receive postrabies prophylaxis within a week if bitten by dogs, bats, raccoons, or other canines (jackals, foxes, wolves). In general, they should avoid all contact with free-roaming dogs <link linkend="ch0038s0002bib14">(14)</link>.</para>
        <para>In the United States and most other industrialized nations, rabies has essentially been eliminated from dogs by an aggressive vaccination program. No such program exists for cats, although 27 U. S. states do require cats to be vaccinated. As a result, cats are four times more likely to be infected<link linkend="ch0038s0002bib15">(15)</link>by rabies compared to dogs. In suburban and rural areas of the United States, people may come in contact with rabid animals, which accounts for over 90% of the U. S. animal rabies cases. The virus is found most frequently in bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. There are approximately one to three human rabies cases in the United States annually. A recent human case reported by the CDC occurred following extensive bat exposure in the patient’s home<link linkend="ch0038s0002bib16">(16)</link>.</para>
