He had felt poorly for the past week, finding it difficult to walk up steps because of shortness of breath (SOB). He presented to the emergency department (ED) during December with chest pain, complaining of increasing chest discomfort, SOB, cough, inability to “catch his breath,” and a “racing heart.”</para>
      <para>On physical examination, he was afebrile with a heart rate of 102 beats/minute and a respiratory rate of 22/minute. He reported that he had occasional night sweats but no hemoptysis. Chest auscultation was unremarkable. On chest computed tomography (CT), extensive, diffuse ground-glass opacities were seen bilaterally, but no pulmonary edema was noted.</para>
      <para>His social history was significant for recent incarceration and current substance abuse disorder.</para>
      <para>Laboratory findings included a normal electrocardiogram and troponin level. His white cell count was 4,100/μl with 1,200/μl lymphocytes. A CD4 count done at an HIV clinic 2 weeks previously was 344 cells/μl.</para>

        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">1.</emphasis>  The finding of chest pain and SOB made ruling out a myocardial infarction essential. The finding of a normal electrocardiogram and troponin levels accomplished this. Oral fluoroquinolone treatment is the current American Thoracic Society recommendation for empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in patients with underlying conditions <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib01">(1)</link>. The care provider likely considered the patient mildly ill since he was afebrile and had an unimpressive chest examination and a normal white blood cell count.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">2.</emphasis>  There are at least three pathogens to consider in an individual living with HIV with a CD4 count of &gt;300 cells/μl.</para>
        <para>Any patient presenting with signs and symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection during “respiratory season” should be tested for influenza so antiviral therapy can be considered, especially in an individual living with HIV<link linkend="ch0016s0002bib01">(1)</link>. Although the COVID-19 pandemic altered the epidemiology of respiratory viruses, the season with the highest rate of positivity for most respiratory viruses is December through March in the Northern Hemisphere.</para>
        <para>The patient had three significant risk factors for <emphasis>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</emphasis> (tuberculosis [TB]) infection: HIV, recent incarceration, and substance abuse disorder <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib02">(2)</link>. A history of occasional night sweats also suggests TB infection. However, the chest CT is not consistent with TB. Nonetheless, the patient should be tested using an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), which is a serologic test that detects an immune response to TB <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib03">(3)</link>. When positive, it indicates that the patient has been exposed to TB and may be actively infected. A negative IGRA result does not rule out active TB, as 8 to 19% of patients with culture confirmed TB can have a false-negative IGRA <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib04">(4)</link>. Any patient presenting with the pulmonary symptoms should be tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This patient had two risk factors for COVID-19 complications—recent incarceration, as people living in congregant settings such as prisons are at increased risk, as are individuals living with HIV, especially those with low CD4 counts or not receiving cART <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib05">(5)</link>. At the time of initial presentation, he had a reduced CD4 cell count but not one associated with opportunistic infections (≤200 cells/μl).</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">3.</emphasis>  The patient has <emphasis>Pneumocystis jirovecii</emphasis> pneumonia (PJP). The fluorescence seen in the picture is a cluster of <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> cysts and trophozoites. The “honeycomb” appearance of the green fluorescing body is due to the binding of the <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> fluorescent antibodies to trophozoites, while the poorly staining “holes” are due to poor binding of these antibodies by <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> cysts. <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> was initially characterized as a protozoan; the terms “cyst” and “trophozoite” are typically used to describe different stages of the life cycle of protozoans that belong to the kingdom <emphasis>Protista</emphasis>. With improved molecular phylogeny, <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> was shown to be genetically more closely related to fungi and has been reclassified into the kingdom <emphasis>Fungi</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib06">(6)</link>. <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> species are highly evolved to live within a particular mammalian host and have never been successfully cultivated <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>.</para>
        <para><emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> (formerly <emphasis>P. carinii</emphasis>) was reported from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Globally, <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> remains one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with advanced HIV disease.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">4.</emphasis>  <emphasis>P. jirovecii</emphasis> causes pneumonia only in immunocompromised individuals, most commonly individuals living with HIV with CD4 counts of &lt;200 cells/μl, but also in patients who have received solid organ or bone marrow transplants or patients with malignancies. There is significant debate about the acquisition of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> prior to the development of clinical infection. Clinical infection may result from the reactivation of a latent infection obtained during childhood or may also represent <emphasis>de novo</emphasis> infection obtained from other infected patients. Outbreaks of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> have been described in solid organ transplant recipients and individuals living with HIV (<link linkend="ch0016s0002bib06">6</link>, <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib07">7</link>). There is evidence of airborne transmission based on molecular detection of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> DNA in air samples <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib06">(6)</link>. Intriguingly, there is also evidence of asymptomatic colonization of health care personnel caring for <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>-infected individuals, again based on molecular detection <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib06">(6)</link>. The data on asymptomatic colonization are suggestive but inconclusive evidence of patient-to-patient transmission or transmission from health care personnel to patients.</para>
        <para>The cyst form of the organism is believed to be its transmissible stage. The cyst has a thick cell wall with high levels of β-D-glucans, which stabilizes the structure of the cyst form of this fungus. The thick cell wall is believed to allow it to survive in the environment before transmission. The cyst contains eight spores that are released when the cyst is deposited into the alveolar space. The spores develop into trophozoites, which bind to type 1 pneumocytes, the cells responsible for air exchange in the alveolar spaces. The trophozoites reproduce asexually, filling the alveolar space with a frothy exudate. As a result, air exchange is compromised, resulting in hypoxia as evidenced by the low pO<subscript>2</subscript>. The patient does not develop a productive cough because the trophozoites do not induce an inflammatory response within the alveolar spaces. The final stage in the life cycle of the pathogen is the fusing of two trophozoites to form a zygote, which undergoes meiosis, which eventually results in the formation of eight spores in a cyst.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">5.</emphasis>  Because all <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> species are highly evolved to grow in specific mammalian hosts, the organism cannot synthesize several different molecules, such as amino acids needed for growth <emphasis>in vitro</emphasis>. Because it cannot be cultured, the standard method for diagnosis is the demonstration of the organism by direct microscopic examination. Several staining techniques have been applied, including direct fluorescent antibodies, Giemsa, Gomori methenamine silver, toluidine blue, and calcofluor white <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib08">(8)</link>. Some stain cysts, such as calcofluor white, Gomori methenamine silver, and toluidine blue, while others stain trophozoites, such as Giemsa and fluorescent antibodies. </para>
        <para>The specimen of choice for diagnosing <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>pneumonia is bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The reason is that the organism specifically infects the alveoli, where cysts and trophozoites are clustered in a proteinaceous exudate. Because the fungus does not induce an inflammatory response, the patient typically has a nonproductive cough and cannot produce sputum. Initially, detection of this organism required an open lung biopsy and multiple stains of this material would be done to detect it. With the development of flexible bronchoscopy, “washing” of alveolar spaces with saline (i. e., BAL) became possible. It became the method of choice for the diagnosis of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> pneumonia.</para>
        <para>At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, pulmonologists in cities such as San Francisco were overwhelmed by requests for bronchoscopies to diagnose <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> pneumonia. As a result, they developed a testing algorithm using induced sputum, a technique that was successfully used previously to detect <emphasis>M. tuberculosis</emphasis>. If induced sputum was positive for <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>, bronchoscopy was unnecessary; if negative and the clinician had a high index of suspicion of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> infection, bronchoscopy with collection of BAL fluid would be done. Induced sputum from HIV-infected patients was found to have a sensitivity of 70% for the detection of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>, while bronchoscopy had a sensitivity of 90% <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib09">(9)</link>. However, induced sputum is poorly sensitive in non-HIV-infected patients, likely because of low organism numbers in this patient population <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib09">(9)</link>. The collection of induced sputum is not recommended for these patients.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">6.</emphasis>  The <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> cyst cell wall contains high levels of β-D-glucans. Assays have been developed to detect this antigen in serum. β-D-Glucan can be used to detect various fungi such as <emphasis>Candida</emphasis>, <emphasis>Aspergillus</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Fusarium</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib10">(10)</link>. These assays do not detect either Cryptococcus or members of the order Mucorales because of low (<emphasis>Cryptococcus</emphasis>) or no (<emphasis>Mucorales</emphasis>) β-D-glucan production <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib11">(11)</link>. This assay is highly sensitive for detecting <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>, with β-D-glucan levels typically much higher than the positive threshold <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib10">(10)</link>. It has been suggested that the positive threshold be increased to improve the assay’s specificity when attempting to “rule out” <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>. This is because colonization or latent infection is well recognized with this organism and false positives may occur when applying lower thresholds of positivity.</para>
        <para>Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been developed for the detection of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Except for one molecular multiplex pneumonia panel, there are no FDA-approved NAATs for the detection of <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> DNA <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib12">(12)</link>. However, several assays are commercially available for research use only, and some clinical laboratories have validated and implemented laboratory-developed tests. There are several impediments to comparing the accuracy of these different assays, including a lack of international <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> DNA standard materials to compare the analytical sensitivities of different assays and to quantify DNA levels to differentiate colonized individuals from those with clinical infections. Data suggest that BAL fluid with a negative Pneumocystis NAAT result has a strong negative predictive value; the same cannot be said for other specimen types <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib12">(12)</link>. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of a positive Pneumocystis NAAT and a β-D-glucan level of &gt;200 pg/ml in an appropriate clinical setting has excellent positive predictive value but modest negative predictive value <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib13">(13)</link>.</para>
        <para>Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of advanced diagnostic methods like molecular amplification and detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) in detecting <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>. For cfDNA detection from plasma, using optimized preanalytical and analytical methods may lead to improved sensitivity without invasive respiratory sampling <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib14">(14)</link>. Additionally, studies suggest that the use of quantitative NAAT in conjunction with clinical assessment may be effective in differentiating between <emphasis>Pneumoncystis</emphasis> colonization and infection <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib15">(15)</link>. Although the developing evidence from performance of advanced diagnostic methods is promising, more data on the implementation and clinical impact of these tests are needed.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">7.</emphasis>On the first visit, the patient was not particularly sick and had a CD4 cell count not in the “danger zone” for opportunistic infection (i. e., &lt;200 cells/μl). On his second visit, the patient’s condition had worsened significantly despite appropriate empiric antibacterial therapy. He also had a clinical workup that further evaluated the status of his HIV infection. Because he was not on cART, his HIV infection might have been poorly controlled. The finding of an HIV viral load of 1,000,000 copies/ml coupled with a significant drop in his CD4 cell count from 344 cells/μl approximately 3 weeks previously to 201 cells/μl on his admission indicates that his HIV infection was rapidly progressing. This put him at risk for opportunistic pulmonary infections, with the most common being PJP.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">8.</emphasis>  Although <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> is a fungus, the three most widely used antifungal classes are ineffective against it. Amphotericin B and the azoles target ergosterol, an important component in the plasma membrane of most fungi. However, <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> lacks that target, with cholesterol being the major sterol in its plasma membrane <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib06">(6)</link>. The other major class of antifungals, echinocandins, inhibits the synthesis of β-D-glucans. The <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> cyst form is rich with β-D-glucans, and so cyst formation is blocked, preventing the spread of the fungus. However, the pathogenic form, the trophozoite, lacks a cell wall, making it resistant to echinocandins <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib06">(6)</link>.</para>
        <para>When <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> was believed to be a protozoan, it was found to be susceptible to TMP-SMX, which blocks steps in thymidine synthesis. This antimicrobial has been the drug of choice, since its effectiveness in clinical trials was reported in the 1970s, partly because it can be given orally <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib16">(16)</link>.</para>
        <para role="ans1"><emphasis role="strong">9.</emphasis>  The initial observation in 1981 of <emphasis><emphasis><emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> pneumonia in previously healthy young men led to the description of AIDS (<link linkend="ch0016s0002bib17">17</link>, <link linkend="ch0016s0002bib18">18</link>). <emphasis>Pneumocysti <emphasis><emphasis>s</emphasis></emphasis></emphasis> pneumonia continues to be the most detected opportunistic infection when individuals are initially diagnosed with HIV infection. </para>
        <para>This patient belongs to the second group of individuals living with HIV who develop <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis> pneumonia. These individuals are known to be living with HIV but are not currently receiving cART. The reasons why they are not receiving cART are varied. They may not be able to access cART because of a lack of access to care, transportation, or for financial reasons, or they may choose not to take cART. Many of these individuals are asymptomatic, but their HIV infection is progressing and reaches a point—typically a CD4 count of &lt;200 cells/μl with high (&gt;10,000 copies/ml) HIV viral load—where their immune systems cannot control opportunistic infections; primary among these is <emphasis>Pneumocystis</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>The final group is those in whom the HIV strain becomes resistant to the antiretroviral therapy they receive, and their HIV infection progresses. This group is small in large part because there have been significant advances in monitoring for drug resistance and improved antiretroviral therapies over the past 4 decades.</para>
